COVEY OF CHINAMEN.
Cargo Landed at Smith's Cove
and Many Captured.
LIVELY CHASE IN THE BRUSH.
An Knrly Riser Finds Himself Among
the Contrabands—An Informer
After Reward.
Eighteen Chinamen, who were smuggled
into Seattle from British Columbia some
time during Friday night, were captured
yesterday and are now in the county jail.
It is thought that the Mongolians were
with a party of nearly forty ot their
brethren who landed on the sand spit at
the mouth of Smith's cove from a sloop
manned by white smugglers.
Nothing was known of the presence of
the Chinamen until about 9 o'clock yester
day morning, when a man who lives near
the sand spit called on the deputy United
States marshal and said:
There are at least sixty smuggled Chinamen
on the sand spit in Smith's cove. If you want
them you'll have to hurry up, for they'll be in
town inside of an hour. I had occasion to cross
the spit about daylight this morning, and I sud
denly found myoelf surrounded t>y a regiment
of men. They were as badly frightened as I, for
the moment they recognized the fart that a
stranger was among them they darted oft in all
directions, aud in a second more none were in
sight, though I could hear them tearing their
way through the underbrush. The moment
they saw me they all yelled; then I knew they
were Chinamen.
The news soon spread. The police were
made aware of the facts, and in a few min
utes Lieutenant Sims was on hand, and
accompanied Deputy United States Mar
shal Mudgett to the sand spit. All
through North Seattle Lieutenant Sims
notified his men to arrest all suspicious
looking Chinamen.
When the officers reached the sand spit
not a soul could be found. There are sev
eral small cabins on the spit, and these
showed evidence of late occupancy. Near
by in the brush was stored a lot of Chinese
baggage, such as clothing, shoes, etc. At
Smith's cove a tall man with a bushy
beard and wearing a yellow oil coat was
found, who stated that the Chinamen
came in on a sloop, that the sloop went as
far in shore as it could, then the captain
compelled the Chinamen to jump over
board into ice cold water up to their mid
dles and wade to shore. The same man
said that the Chinamen all got together on
the spit, and, after storing their baggage,
left towards Seattle, going around the head
of the cove. It was later reported that a
party of twenty Chinamen were seen going
over Queen Anne hill in a body. About
10 o'clock Officer John Kelley, who has a
North Seattle beat, saw three Chinamen
walking rapidiv down Front street. They
were muddy, one of them was shoeless
and all of them were wet to their waists
as if they had been wading. He took them
to police headquarters.
A few minutes after 10 o'clock Officer
Stepler arrested two Chinamen coming
down Third street from Tike. They were
evidently strangers, for they seemed lost
and were wandering about in an aimless
way. They, too, were wringing wet nearly
all over. Just about this time a telephone
message came in from Stimson'e mill for
an officer to meet car No. 3 from Ballard.
Captain Barck accompanied the patrol
wagon to West street, arriving there just
as the car stopped. A Chinaman jumped
off and the conductor sang out:
1 guess you want him, Captain. He came In
with about 560, more or less, la*t night. He was
walking down the track toward town and 1
said:
"Want a ride, John?"
He said, "You bet," and we took him and
thought we'd turn him over to you.
An hour Inter the six Chinamen were
given a free ride in the patrol wagon to
the county jail, where they were locked
lip. One of them had on seventeen shirts
and another guarded against wintry blasts
by wearing eleven coats and seven pairs of
trousers. They had their wardrobes on
their backs.
The biggest capture was yet to come and
It was made at 12 o'clock by Deputy Sheriff
Taylor Holden, ex-Policeman Cummings
and Chinese Inspector Munn. Munn had
been out on Queen Anne hill taking in the
situation and had lost two Chinamen
whom lie saw at a distance, but who
escaped him by taking to the brush near
Lakw Union. lie was returning to the
city when he met Deputy Sheriff'Taylor
Holden, who had one Chinaman in cus
tody. Holden saw him dodging about on
West street and picked him up. All three
men put their heads together and con
cluded to raid the Chinese wash-house at
the corner of West and Lenora streets.
The owner of the wash-house has long
been suspected by the officers of harboring
his contraband countrymen. Munn went
into the laundry the front way and Holden
and Cummings the back way. Holden
caught two Chinamen just as they were
leaving the premises and lie forced them
back into the house, where they were
guarded by Cumminss, together with the
hrst one who was caught.
When the officers entered the laundry
the occupants were greatly aiarmed and
hid under tables and beds and some took
to the garret. In all nine were caught,
which, with the one Holden had
previously arrested, made ten. Every
one of them were wet to the waists,
which convinced the officers that they
were among the party which landed at
Smith's cove Friday nieht. They were
»*ll taken to the county jail, searched and
locked up.
One of the Chinamen had addresses of
Chinese firms in Portland, San Fran
cisco. San Diego, Denver, Chicago, New
York and Boston, showing that he had
been in communication with his country
men, who were evidently m league with
the smugglers.
A few minutes after 11 o'clock in the
morning a tall man with a bushy beard
»nd wearing a yellow oil coat jumped off a
Ballard car at the foot of University
street, and going up to Policeman John
Sanstrom said:
"Officer, what does a fellow get for put
tins the law onto smuggled Chinamen?"
"Your witness fees."
"Is that all ?"
"Yes."
"Well, I guess there's more money in it
for me to lieip get them in than turn them
over. There's a whole slew of them up
at Smith's cove. I can lay my hands on
them at any time."
The man went away, the officer thinking
he was "light" in the upp»r story. A half
hour later he heard about the capture of
the first eight Chinamen, and tnen re
gretted he had not arrested the old man.
The arretted Chinamen gave their names
as Ah Lee, Ah Ten, Ah lloyt. Ah Chong,
Ah >in, Lee Ying, Fong Norn, Chong Con!
Ah Yinsr, I>ong Chong, Bee You. Lee
Qtionc, Gong Loon, Ah Toy, Fong Chong,
ChingQuon, Ah Chong, You Ka.v. They
will be given a hearing before a United
States commissioner today.

iiPLIT IN THE RANKS.
People's Party Fighting for
Visionary Spoils.
TWO CONVENTIONS CALLED.
Knox and His Organ Jump the Traees—
Cries of Treachery—The I'arty's
"Crowing" Strength.
Though the statement may not be cred
ited generally, it is a fact nevertheless that
the local organization of the People's party
has finally acquired sufficient vitality to
cause a split—a big split—in its ranks.
The scramble for power—for authority—
could be restrained no longer, and the in
evitable has happened.
The faithful—whoever that may mean—
claim that M. F. Knox, one of the prime
movers and editor of die People's Call, and
Eugene Miller, chairman of the district
organization, have overridden the au
thority of the central club aud on their
own responsibility called a city con
vention for January S to nominate
a city ticket. The central club had
issued a call for a masß convention
to be held on January 7 to consider the
situation, appoint a central committee and
prepare lor an active campaign, organizing
clubs all through the city and then when
an organization was buiit up hold a con
vention for the nomination of a city ticket.
It is claimed that this proposition did not
meet with the approval of the high chiefs
and at the meeting of the Central Ciub
Thursdav night Knox resigned the chair
manship and, going out backed by the
mighty induence of a newspaper, the party
organ, of which he is editor-in-chief, and
also by the chairman of the district organ
ization, he has assumed the position of
dictator and called a convention of his
own. After Knox handed in his resigna
tion and his scheme was made apparent
he was roundly denounced.
A meeting of eight or ten of Knox's fol
lowers was held in his office last evening,
and when a Post Intei.ligencer reporter
inquired of Mr. Knox the object of the
meeting, he replied that it was for the
purpose of organizing a stock company
and incorporating for the management of
the People's Call.
"How about this split in the People's
party ?" queried the reporter. Mr. Knox
replied:
Why, there is no split. Everything Is per
fectly harmonious. That was simply a Demo
cratic lie started to injure us. Wo expect the
Republicans to start similar lies; but we are
gaining members at the rate of over 100 per day,
just the same. There has b*.'on nothing to di
vide on. The convention called for January Bis
to nominate n city ticket, aud that is all
there is to it. The conv«ution has been regu
larly called, and there is no call ior a conven
tion on the 7th, as far as I snow.
The mass convention on the 7th is
called for 7 o'clock in the evening at the
Knights of Labor hall, but the hour and
place of meeting of the nominating con
vention called for the Sth has not yet been
announced. The faithful rather incline to
the belief that it is the intention to keep
the matter a secret, so that only the chosen
can have an opportunity of participating
in the nomination of themselves for the
several offices.
The large accessions to the ranks, to
which Mr. Knox referred as averaging
"over 100 per day," now compose four
ward clubs of from twenty-live to fifty
members each, and a central club of about
100 members, most of whom are members
of the ward clubs.
1)11.1, LABOR MARKET.
All Trades Doing Little—Moulders and
Plumber* Still Striking.
The general expression of mechanics is
that work is very slack in nearly all the
trades at present, though there is a feeling
that there will be considerable improve
ment in a month or six weeks.
'Longshoremen report work remarkably
scarce the past two months and about all
they can do is earn enough to keep them
in food and clothing.
The Iron Moulders' Union held a meet
ing Saturday night, but the members
stated that no further action had been ta
ken in the Moran trouble. They said the
union proposed to maintain the stand it
had taken in reopening the tight and that
things were now in the same position, as
far as the uuion was concerned, as when
the strike began. They report work very
dull, but few men doing anything and
those working unsteadily.
The Shipwrights' Union held a meet
ing Saturday night. The attendance was
small. Those employed at the trade re
port nothing doing.
The plumbers' strike is just where it was
at tho start. Both sides are holding out
firmly, each expecting the other to yield
iu a few days.

JOE KENTZIKU FINED..
n« Pay* Dearly for the As*ault on Ilia
Divorced Wife.
Joseph Kentzler was lined $lO and costs
by Justice N eagleyesterday upon a charge
of assaulting his wife. In all the fine
amounted to s'27. The evidence showed
that Mrs. Kcntz'er intended going to Mon
tana. and an Christmas day she went to
her former husband's home with herinfant
daughter in her arms to see her two chil
dren for the last time. When she was
about to leave with the child she had
brought wi'.h her, Kentzler stopped her,
saying:
"You can't leave this house with that
child."
She tried to get past him, but he took
the child from her and then told her to
leave. She went away and swore out the
warrant wnich subsequently caused his
arrest.

THE RAINFALL I> JANTIRT.

U. S. DFPIRTMKXT of AaRicuiTTTM, 1
Wkathek Bu*eau,
Pacific Coast Division,
Clas Francisco, Dec. 30.,
Next to December, January is the wet
test month of the year on the Pacitic slope,
and the general rule covering the Decem
ber distribution of precipitation is fol
lowed very closely by the January falls,
except that on the middle California coais
the raina become slightly heavier in li>
caUties.
The heaviest precipitation occurs in a
belt some twenty to twenty-live miles wide
aiong the Washington coast and in Ore
gon north and south of Coos county, ex
tending southward into California ov r
the upper coast range, except that
the bolt of heaviest rains is here
deilected to the eastward, leaving
Humboldt county with bat four inch's
ot rain whilst from ten to fifteen inches fails
farther in the interior, the belt ending 1 y
being projected to the coast in Mendocino
county. There is also an area over the
upper Cascade mountains in Oregon that
has excessive precipitation, and a section
embraced bv Butte to Eldorado counties,
just east of the Sierras, in California
where from eight to over eleven inches of
precipitation usually falls, Marin and
Santa Clara counties usually have about
six inches, and on the lower coast, Ven
tura county and a section south of the
San Bernardino mountains usually has
about four inches, with from four to seven
inches in the interior of San Diego county.
The chart of the January rains on the
Paciiie slope shows a general average of
three inches of precipitation north ot the
31st parallel in California, excepting only
from two to four inches in extreme north
east California and a like amount in the
Sacramento valley. Between the 36th anl
38th parallel from one to four inches usu«
ally falls, the lesser amounts in the east
ern portions,and south of the 36th pnrallei
along the coast from two to four inches,
decreasing to but a few tenths of an inch
in the eastern half of this section.

More Horse Show.
New York Letter.
It is not at ail strange that the first so
cial function of the season should give the
tone to all that follow. The opening event
was called the "Horse Show," because, in-
cidentally, there were real horses, tailor
made though they were, in it, and they
were the excuse for the far greater, if not
far liner, parade of fashionable women in
costly costumes. The opera opening was
a continuance of the horse show. It was
precisely for the same purpose and was
patronized by the same people. It would
not be wonderful if the delusiou that every
excitement must be, to some extent,
equine, went so far that the theater parties
this winter would only patronize places of
amusement which present burlesques or
farces that aflord a jjood deal of "horse
play." Two or three of the Wagner operas
not only permit but compel the introduc
tion of horses, and as these are the only
features in the opera likely to momentar
ily interest the principal patrons, they
can go through the present Italian, or
French, or anything out German season
with the consolation that the box chatter
will not be disturbed by anything on tho
read in the newspapers the grave criti
cisms of operatic performances already
given. But the same sort of amusement
has been afforded ever since the Metropol
itan opera-house was opened. This greas
brick barn oi a building was originally
the l ave of Adullam of the disgruntled,
newly male millionaires who could not get
boxes in tiie close corporation then exist
ing, the stockholders in the Academy of
Music. To be sure, the new mushroom set
drew the old set into the big barn, for
when the old Academy was sold for an
everyday show shop tor whatever attrac
tion might come along, there must needs
be a place lor opera, otherwise for horsa
show. For the past six or seven years tha
performances in the big barn have pro
fessedly been Wagnerian, though very
h w of the box buyers would have known
the dillerence if the opera had been Hi«
bernian. And herein hes the fun of tha
elaborate criticisms, as if the lyric repre
sentation on the stage, of whatever
" ohool" or character, was of any c>*.
sequence in comparison with the horsa
show ami horse play in the IH>XCS. Plain
people, professing only to be lovers of
music, with such accessories in the way of
acting and scenery as opera admits, who
have gone to the big barn and paid their
inonev in the foolish expectation of Ret
ting the worth of it, have been grievously,
even indignantly, disappointed. They
Simply have been niphtly insulted by the
ill-mannwred people who "owned" the big
barn. The wildest Wagnerian noise on
the stage or in the orchestra was actually
murmurous in comparison with the inces
sant dm in the boxes, it will be so this
winter. Anti-W agneriana, of the deluded
class who fancy that they go to "hear thi
opera," are congratulating themselves that
they are going to ".ret some melody as
last." If they are there is going to be
some unexpected variation in the "social
chatter," for the principal "music," such
as it is, wiil continue to come from the
boxes.
