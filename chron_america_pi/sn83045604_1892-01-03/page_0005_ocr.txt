gammer they advanced SI,OOO as part pay
ment and took a mortgage upon certain

MRS. PAYNE WANTS A DIVORCE.
lays She Gave l'p « Pension for a Cruel
Husband.
Amanda M. Payne brought suit yester
day for divorce from her husband, George
W. Payne. She alleges that they were
married on July 29, 1891, and that at that
time she was receiving $8 per month pen
sion as the widow of a deceased soldier.
The marriage was not a happy one accord
ing to Mrs. Payne's story. She says that
her husband has treated her in a cruel and
inhuman manner, rendering her life a
burden. She says that on the night of
December 30, 1891, he called her a prosti
tute and cursed and abused her in the
presence of another, to her exceeding
fhame, and that on the night of December
27, 1891, he accused her of unchastity and
assaulted her by seizing her by the throat
and choking her. All his accusations, she
■ays, are untrue, and she wants a divorce.
A hearing on the motion for alimony
will be given on January 5.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 1892.
HARDEE'S MINE DEAL.
He Claims That Owens' Drafts
Were His Commission.
OWENS* LETTER NOT RECEIVED.
Principal and Agent GIT« Contradictory
Versions of the Transaction—The
Hearing Continued.
John F. Hardee, who was arrested De
cember 22 on a warrant sworn out by H.
K. Owens, the civil engineer, charging
him with larceny by embezzlement, was
given a hearing before Justice Von Tobel
yesterday. At 5 o'clock last evening the
examination was not concluded and a con
tinuance was gramed untii Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
According to Mr. Owens' story he met
Hardee some time in October and had a
conversation with him about a mine in
the Kootenai country, near Ainsworth.
Hardee said that the mine, which was
owned by E. Harrop, contained a rich de
posit, and that Harrop was anxious to
bond it with a view to selling it. After
some correspondence with Mr. Harrop,
Mr. Owens* concluded to purchase the
bond, the price being SI,OOO. He engaged
Hardee, who posed as a mining expert, to
examine the mine and to act as his
agent should a deal be made. He gave
him SI,OOO in drafts—one SSOO draft and
two others for $250 each. He went to
Ainsworth with Hardee and remained a
few days, and then went away. He after
ward wrote to Hardee telling him that he
did not wish to buy the bond on the mine
and not to turn the draft over to Harrop.
He never heard from Hardee until the
news came that Harrop bad been given
the drafts; that he had indorsed them,
taking SSOO and turning over to Hardee
S.VX). Mr. Owens declared that it was a
cold-blooded steid.
On the stand Hardee told at length the
business relations that had existed be
tween himself and Mr. Owens. He said:
I became acquainted with Mr. Owens several
months ago. One day I returned from British
Columbia, and, meeting Mr. Owens, told him
that I knew of a mine near Ainsworth which
the owner, E. Harrop, was auxious to bond. He
wrote to Harrop, and Mr. Owens engaged me to
act a» agent for him. I was to take an interest
in the mine, and for handling his interest I was
to receive u commission and have all of my ex
penses paid.
I went to Ainsworth and saw Harrop. 1 ar
ranged privately with him to receive a commis
sion should I succeed in making a deal for the
sale of his property. Of course I didn't tell
Mr. Owens about that.
Well, I didn't hear from Owens at all. If he
wrote to me I didn't get the letter. 1 closed the
deal by buying the bond on the mine with the
JI,OOO which Owens give me. It was Owens'
money and I acted for him. I then asked Har
rop about the commission he bad promised mo.
He v aid be had not forgotten it, and he gaTe me
|suo and kept the other |joo himself.
Hardee was not cross-questioned. When
he had finished his story the case was con
tinued until tomorrow morning, when he
will be put on the stand again.
THE TEACHERS' CONVENTION.
Creditable Showing of Seattle and
Ballard Schools—School Notes.
Superintendent Barnard, of the city
schools, is enthusiastic over the results of
the recent convention of the Washington
State Teachers' Association at Fairhaven.
The Seattle schools took a prominent part
in the meeting, and their exhibit attracted
a great deal of attention and praise.
Among its best features were the drawing
and crayon work and clay modeling by
pupils under the instruction of Miss E. S.
Small. Another thing that added materi
ally to the entertainment of those who
attended the convention was a physical
culture drill given by sixteen grammar
grade pupils of the Seattle schools in the
Fairhaven opera-house. The class consisted
of eight boys and eight girls, clad in neat
uniforms, who had been thoroughly
trained by Miss Goodrell, the instructress
in physical culture. The entertainment
was pronounced a splendid success by
some of the best educators in the state,
who were among those who witnessed it.
Count School Superintendent V. A.
Pusey, who returned on New Year's
night, was aiso highly pleased. He said:
"The gathering was a very enjoyable
one and was a success in every way. The
Ballard exhibit escaped mention in the
published reports, though it was almost as
good as that of Seattle, and was conse
quently a very creditable showing.
"There were in attendance about
teachers from various portions of the
state. There were a good many more not
enrolled who attended merely as visitors.
The teachers all left Fairhaven New Year's
eve, some coming down on the Premier,
others on the City of Seattle and still
more by rail."
A new school has been opened at Latona.
in charge of Miss Beatrice Evers.
Miss Schofield has been transferred from
the Columbia to the Mercer school.
The position vacated by Miss Mary
Brown is being temporarily filled by Miss
All is.

CITY BUOYS WANTED.
Port Warden Calls Attention to
an Urgent Need.
A DEAL HALF CONSUMMATED.
Adrlied to Sot O. I. Co.—Damage
to the Virgil Prico Still Unsettle*
—Water Front \ot»i.
Port Warden Rogers, i n h:s annual re
port, urges the city council to have some
good buoys placed in the harbor in forty
fathoms of water and establish a nominal
rate for their use by vessels. He says the
lack of pood buoys in this harbor has been
a great inconvenience to vessels loading
here. He also urges the board of public
works to get out an injunction to prevent
the Oregon Improvement Company from
repairing the slip at the foot of Jackson
street. It appears the Oregon Improve
ment Company, after the lire, agreed to
sell the improvements on this slip to the
city at a nominal rate, provided the com
pany was ailowed to use the foot of Main
street as a dock between its two wharves.
The city never bought the improvements,
however, and Captain Rogers says the Ore
gon Improvement Company has taken in
more wharfage from that slip than he has
from all the city slips put together, be
cause it was more convenient. Now, he
says, it has become dangerous, and the
company proposes to repair it, and he
thinks this should not be permitted, as the
street belongs to the city, and all the busi
ness can be done on the other city slips.
VIRGIL PRICE ON" THE WATS.
The IQ( Will Be Repaired by the
Union Pacific Company.
The wreck of the tug Virgil Price was
placed on the marine ways at the dry
dock Friday evening, but no satisfactory
adjustment of the loss has yet been made.
Port Captain Rathbone. of the Union Pa
cific, said last evening that he expected to
reach an understanding with Captain T. N.
Price, the owner of the tug,very soon, and,
if not, the company would go ahead and
repair her.
The damage is variously estimated from
$1,500 to $2,500 by those who viewed the
wreck as it lay on the ways. The bow was
cut off just forward of the house as clean
as though she were an apple box. The
balance of the hull seems to be but little
damaged aside from the stem and guards
being smashed in several places by the
cables used in raising her. The rudder
stock is broken off, and the house is com
pletely demolished. Her machinery is all
right aside from the little damage it sus
tained by lying in the salt water.
OLYMPIAN IN PREMIER'S PLACE.
The "Hoodoo" Lifted by Capt. O'Brien
Hsfinir a Man's Life.
The steamer Olympian will take the
place of the Premier on the Whatcom
route while the latter is laid up for repairs.
Those who have been talking about the
Premier being "hoodooed" on account of
her recent run of hard luck now say that
the Olympian will lift the "hoodoo."
Captain O'Brien did his best to do this
himself on his last trip, for when the ves
sel put into the Sehome dock on her last
trip on New Year's eve., lie rescued John
M, Cohn, who had fallen from the wharf
and had been banging to a pile for half an
hour.
Building a Light-Draft Steamer.

tive days. In about a week he also expects
to begin the building of another steamer.

years of age, employed as a sawyer in
J. L. Taylor's logging ca'v.p on Mercer

were towing logs, crossed Lake Washin

sistance. They were unsuccessful in
