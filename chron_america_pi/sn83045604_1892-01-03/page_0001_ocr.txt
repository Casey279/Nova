Columbus, 0., Jan. 2,-rThe senatorial
contest is still unsolved. The speakership
contest is over, and Laylin, the Sherman
candidate, is nominated, but the result
has failed to brin? that cheerful acquies
cence in the inevitable that the Sherman
people so confidently expected from
Foraker and his followers. Indeed the
doughty ex-governor has lost none of
that conviction of ultimate success
which has characterized his actions
throughout, if his words and outward de
meanor tonight are any criterion of his
inward thoughts. The Sherman men say
the light is over: that all that remains is
but a perfunctory formality; while the
Foraker men say the light is just begin
ning to get interesting.
There is one other prominent Ohio Re
publican besides Senator Sherman who
PF.NATOB SHERM ATT.
does not share the view of friends of For
aker. This is Secretary of the Treasury
Foster, who telegraphed congratulations to
Sherman as soon as he heard the
result of the speakership caucus. "Foster
has been all the time the agent of the ad
ministration in the effort to elect Sher
man, and this telegram is but a scheme to
demoralize the other forces and cause a
stampede to Sherman," said George Cox,
of Cincinnati, the chief lieutenant of
Foraker. "I am not discouraged," said
Foraker, calmly, "and I still expect to
win. Five men voted for Laylin who will
vote for me."
There was an air of inter e discourage
ment in the Foraker headquarters im
mediately after the caucus, but the cheer
ful words of the ex-governor soon restored
the feeling of conndence. until tonight the
Forager phalanx have apparently forgot
ten the very cold wave that swept over
their camp but a few hours since.
Around the headquarters of Senator
Sherman was all the cheerfulness of ex
pectant victory.
"J he Afi >eia;ed Prois would like to know,
senator, how you regard the situation now,"
hherman WHS asked.
"Very favorably," he replied, in a tone of
quiet assuranee which pave evidence that he,
too, like his friend*, regarded ths battle as prac
tically fought and won.
"1 he s;eakership contest," continued he, "has
been, it is generally conceded, fought upon
senatorial lines. In the Senate, 1 think, it is
conceded that a very large majority, some say
nearly two to one, are friendly to inc."
"What do you expect your niajoritj to be in
joint caucus?''
"Oh, 1 don't say as to figures," replied Senator
Sherman. "I expect to be nominated, and do
not know that tho figures are at all material.'*
It is generally understood that the sena
torial j>mt caucus will not be held until
JOSEPH nrv«ov munoi
Wednesday or Thursday evenin? of next
week, and the decisive re-ult cannot he
known until that time. At a caucus of
Republican senators this aftern >on, Sena

Ev. ry now and then some stupendous
s: .ry is originated that is expected to do
Mr. Biaine some sort of injury. Jast at

state in this city are pointing at "the

this late and base shin ier.
rhe Minneapolis Tri'a-.ne. Harrison's or
gan in Minnesota, has within the last
week printed a story wliich, it is charged,
is intended to do Mr. Blaine further in
jury in ttie interest of President Harri
son s renominatiou. The Tribune pub
lished a dispatch from Sioux Fails. S. D.,
referring to the divorce suit of James G.
Blaine, jr., which is shortly to be tried in
that city. This article also suggests that
the Elaine domestic scandal which was
sprung by the Democrats in the campaign
ot 18-4 is likely to be revived again and
used with considerable effect by the Demo
crats, provided Blaine secures the presi
dential nomination next year. The friends
of President HsArison in Washington City
discussed the matter today and were also
very lrank, saying that they did not sanc
tion any plan of this kind, and it was the
general opinion ot those who had hear !
anything about the publication that it was
unwise and impolitic in every set.se. Sen
ator Hansborough, of North Dakota, said
to the Post-Intelligencer correspondent
tonight that no words of condemnation
were strong enough to state his opinion of
the man or newspaper that would attempt
to smirch the character of any public man
by reviving or printing any domestic scan
dal relating to any member of his family
who was unfortunate enough to be con
nected with divorce proceedings.
THE SENATE COMMITTEES.
Senator Allen Highly Honored —Boston
••Journal" Compliments Him.
WASHINGTON CITY, Jan. 2.— [Special.]—
A careful study ot the makeup of the com
mittees in both of the congressional
branches shows that the West and North
western states have fared remarkably
well. On the Senate side some of the
members from the new states did not get
ail the committee assignments that they
desired, but on the whole the majority of
those members have been placed upon
committees where they will be able to do
excellent work for their several states. It
was not expected that the Northwest
would get very much in the way of
important committee assignments on the
House side. The state of Washington,
however, was very well treated. Con
gressman Wilson was placed upon several
important committees and will be able, no
doubt, to do good work for his con
stituents.
Senator Allen secured only one chair
manship, it is true, and all along the com
mittee of which he is at the head has not
been considered really important. It is a
fact, however, that it is one of the most
important committees of the Senate, al
though it has not been as yet made a
standing committee. It can be stated,
however, upon excellent authority, that
the committee will probably t>e made a
standing one at this session of congress,
and it will then become one of the most
important ones in the upper branch of
congress. As has already been telegraphed,
Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, has been
at the head of the committee on relations
with Canada for several sessions, and that
he retired from the chairmanship to make
a place tor Senator Alien. The conserva
tive old Boston Journal in discussing the
new committee assignments recently
stated that the committee on relations
with Canada has always been considered
a minor committee, but, in reality, it
says, it is one of the important ones.
In speaking of Mr. Allen's assignment to
the chairmanship, the Boston Journal
credits him with being one of the ablest
senators from the new states. In a local
sense the committee on relations with
Canada is very important to the state of
Washington, and it is probable that Sena
tor Allen, as the head of this committee,
will be able to accomplish a good many
things for his constituents in shaping the
deliberations of legislation that this coun
try desires to bring about with Canada,
and will also be able to raise this commit
tee to a very much higher standard than
it is at present. There have been some
criticisms in the press of Wash
ington upon Senator Allen's course
in not crowding himself to
the front and trying to secure places or
chairmanships on other committees. It
is apparent here that these criticisms are
unjust, for Senator Allen is held in high
estimation by his colleagues, and they
were very anxious to give him some im
portant place in the make-up of the com
mittees, and did so by placine him at the
head of the committee on relations with
Canada.
Senator Squire, of course, is on some
very good committees, and will use every
effort to carry out important legislative
work for his state in conjunction with
Senator Allen, Congressman Wilson and
his other colleagues from the Northwest.

TorEKA. Kan., Jan. 2.—Senator IVrkins,
when asked today if his position on the
tariff and silver would be radically differ
ent from that of Senator Plumb, replied:
Senrtor I'lunib had radically changed his
▼lews on these questions within the pnst year.
I voted for the M' Kiuley bill a >d Plumb votet
against it, but he had lately given it as his
opinion that it wa* a wise piece of legislation.
As far a« the silver question is concerned, I do
not believe any thing wi.l be done at this session.
In an interview today at Atchison, ex-
Senator Ingalls said he was confident
Governor Humphrey's choice would be
commended and approved by the Repub
licans of the state and country, that Judge
Perkins was an able man and will be pe
culiarly acceptable to Piumb's supporters.
The Nebraska Governorship Contest.
LINCOLN, Neb. Jan, 2.—Governor Thayer,
as well as other state officers, decline to
express themselves relative to a rumor
from Washington <itv. The supreme
court will de< ide in favor of Boyd in a
gubernatorial wrangle. The opinion
among leading politicians is divided as to
the truth or falsity of the report.
OMAH\, Neb.. Jan. ±—Kx-Governor
Bovd received a telegram from Washing
ton City this morning confirming the
statement that the supreme court would
decide the governorship question in his
favor. The governor said tiie dispatch
«t3ted that tiie information was given un
der conditions that the informant's mime
was not to e <fcs< :••*« i. and that the mat
ter was not to be published until the time
he would indicate, lioyd further stated
that he did not place implicit confidence in
the report, but was im lined to wait until
Monday, when a decision will '>« rendered.
He is inclined to think, however, ttiat his
chances were good.

\ alparatro, Jan. 2. —[New York TTerald
Special.]— The procurator tiscal has con
cluded his review ot the Baltimore case.
He finds Rogriguez, (lomaz and Azumada,
three ot the rioters held by Judge Foster,
guilty of stabbing and otherwise wound
ing American sailors, but says the evi
dence is not strong enough to
show that the wounds indicted by
the prisoners caused the death of
Boatswain's Mate Kigsrin and Coal Heaver
Turnbnll. He linds the Baltimore «ailor
Davidson guilty of assault upon Chilean
sailors. Rodriguez acknowledges stabbin?
Rigein because the latter assaulted one of
the crew of the Chilean torpedo boat
Almirante Cochrane. Seeing the seaman
ill treated, Rodriguez stuck a knife into
Itiggin's back. Gomaz admitted stabbing
lurnbull in the back three times,
and said lie did so in defending some
friends whom Tarnbull knocked down.
Azumada denied having anything to do
with the assault, but was shown by other
witnesses to have participated. Cortes,
another prisoner, also alleped that he took
no part in the affair. A revolver was
found on him, but he said he carried it
to defend himself. It now only remains
for Judge Foster to pass sentence on the
three convicted prisoners. Relative to
Cortes' implication, the prosecution says
more data are required. Fiscal comes to
the conclusion that it is impossible to de
termine who fired the first shot, which
killed liiggin.
It will be remembered that one of the
witnesses, according to Judge Foster's re
port, testified that he saw three policemen
holding Kiggin at, the time the fatal shot
was fired.
A prominent official today informed the
Herald correspondent that Minister Pedro
Montt had been notitied that the
Chilean government waa willing
and anxious to accept arbitra
tors mutually agreeable to both
conntries in the Baltimore affair. If that
conrse is accepted by the United States
the entire report of Fiscal will be cabled
Monday for the information of the United
States government.
It is probable an extended amnesty bill
will be proclaimed shortly.
SAN DIEOO, Cal., Jan. 2. —lt is reported
tonight that the Baltimore was lying off
the harbor, showing a search-iight.
If it is the Baltimore, she evidently does
not intend to come into the harbor to
nieht.
The cruiser Charleston began taking on
supplies of ammunition from the cruiser
San Francisco this morning, the latter
vessel displaying a red flag at the foretop
masthead when the transfer of powder
was commenced. The San Francisco
has begun taking on supplies,
the first item being 33,000
gallons of water. No orders have been re
ceived yet beyond requiring the vessels to
be ready for sea at a moment's notice. It
was stated yesterday that San Diego wonld
be the base of supplies and operations in
the event of trouble with Chile,
and that the entire Pacific squadron, in
cluding the Boston, would rendezvous at
this port. There was also a report last
night that General McCook had made ar
rangements for quarters for three com
panies of artillery which would be ordered
here.
WASHINGTON CITY. Jan. 2. —Xo dis
patches were received at the departments
today touching on the «'hilean situation.
Secretary Blaine spent several hours at
the department of state and saw the
British minister and several other
persons, but Senor Montt, the Chilean
minister, was not among the visitors.
At the navy department it was admitted
that Judge Advocate General Kemy is on
his way to San Francisco to m ike formal
inquiry into the Baltimore incident on
the arrival of that vessel. The testimony
will be reduced to form and turned
over to the department of state to
be used in meeting the representations
to be made by the Chilean government. It
may also be regarded a* proper to include
the testimony to he collected bv the judge
advocate general in the correspondence to
be transmitted to congress t>y the presi
dent. if this should be the purpose, the
correspondence could not be sent to con
gress before the latter part of the present
month.
An inquiry, it is stated, has been sent to
San Francisco, asking for an estimate of
the cost of fitting up a big merchant ves
sel into a tloatinT machine and renair shop.
It is proposed to outfit the ship
in a complete manner, so that if any
break whatsoever occurs in one of our
vessels. repairs fin he made speedily and
at aM times and the expense of senlinp a
vessel to the navy yard can be save 1. In
this rase speedy action is desired, and
such a vessel will undoubtedly be
furnished with all nece-sarv machinery
and tools, and be sent to Southern waters
if a war should o< cur with Chile.
PERMS, Jan. 2.—Reports have reached
here by cable that the German minister
ha«! offered tin* good offices of Gorrnanv as
