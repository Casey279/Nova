I here should have the power to secure it. Hut
popular sentiment must be founJed upon rignt
principles in order to accomplish go«>d tesu.U.
When fair and crooked work meet about an
equal share of adverse criticism, there 1a not
much chance for reform.
The course of afiaira in the department of
amateur boxing has been the subject of much
dispute recently, and the air has oeen full of
arousal.«ns and denials. The ehargj of pro
ieMiona.ism has be«n freely ma le and no
wall-informed person can doubt that
it ba» Mime foundation. I sl.al: have something
tossy abo*4t it in the latter p >rtion of thle let
ter. An ither aqiad of critica has deslt with the
matter of decisions, claiming that, through in
eonipeteuce and prejudice on the part of judges
and referees, the best boxers frequently missed
tbe medals. It la on this subject that 1 have
been asked to give an opinion.
A «|>ort in wlii''h the best men do not win can
saver bolu a place. Participants and spectators
•000 tire of unfair contests. The sentiment of
Justice is deep-seated and easily offended. Spec
tators of a boxing contest are to rise in
protest at a decision which looks bad. But they
are not always risrftt even when nearly unan
imous; indeed, the kickers are much more often
wrong.
Ills Impossible for a referee to every
body; It is hard enough for him to act so that
bis own sense of justice will be satisfied after
wards. But I believe that this arduous position
In generally well filled.
It should be remembered that in a crowd of
tOOO or 3.0U0 sp ecu tors there are or linarily not
more than iifty really good judges of boxing,
tnd no great proportion of ao large a number
cau be near the ring. It is not easy to appre
ciate the tine points of a boxing match unless
ene is reasonably close to the contestants.
Then, too, with good judges and a fair
▼lew there will be room for a dillerence of
opinion. I have sat with Billy Edwards,
tor instance, in a box at the Metropolitan
opera-house during the Amateur Athletic
Colon's contest-, and have disagreed with
biin more than once in the eourse of the even

It is a well-known fact that after the great fire and during the boom which followed in its wake, that rents and expenses of all kinds
ran high as mountains, and that prices on all kinds of merchandise were placed at exorbitant figures. During the past year
expenses of all kinds have greatly reduced, thereby allowing of great reductions in such goods and materials as
are what we may term the necessaries of life. We have now begun a new era in our line of busi
ness by taking into consideration the condition of the times, the excellent quality of our goods, and concluding
that selling goods at the very lowest prices possible is SELLING THEM, and regardless of the times we shall not
be compelled to carry from one season to another goods that should remain no longer than the trade of that season demands. Therefore

Does the boxer b?trsy his intention or di.es ha

counts for the defense as virely as a blow well

It's smash, bang, give and take. This lively
work is often allowed to drive the rest of the
round out of o ie's mind. As for me, suppose
one man leads tnroe or four times and hits his
adversary w;thout getting a return, and th>>n
there is a rally and the other fellow gets a little
the better of it. I am dis;>os.'d to look tavorably
on No. 1. He has shown himself a good judk*e
of distance and has timed his adversary well,
and these are exceedingly important points.
Iu mv opinion Harry Beunneyer. as everybody
calls him, is the best referee we have in these
parts. I don't mean to reflet upon others,
but t» emphasize my liking for Mr. Bi-urmeyer.
He has not escaped criticism. Who has?
But I've watched his decisions In three
champ.ouship meetinrs and hav disagreed with
him just once I'hat was, I believe, two years

the amateur lightweight champion. 1 forget

In g-.-nerai, I wi»h to repeat my statement t.iat
the sport suffer* liuie from bad decision*. They
are much fewer than the public is led to be
lieve.
A good deal is said about foul fightine. I be
lieve iu prompt disqualification tor intentional
viciou* fouling. I don't take very much stock
in what is called shouldering. It is hard to do
any damage that way. I'.it Cahill was accused
of it in his recent fight with .lim Butler. 1 tiidn't
see the battle, but I know Cahili's style very
well, and 1 am inclined to believe that his real
intention was to getciose to his man in order to
deliv r his favorite blow, which is a right-hand
swing on the jaw given at close quarters and
with a peculiar lift oi the body.
Batting is a dangerous practice and should
disqualify any tighter who does it with malice.
Another bad foul is the elbow trick. It is worked
at the breaking of a ell ch, sometimes with a
simple "jab," or perhaps with the pivot If I
SHW a man hurt by this trick in a fight 1 would
certainly give him the decision.
The pivot blow generally bears La Blanche's
name now, though it is real v Jimmy Carroll's.
Heclaims that he hits with the "hoe of his
hand." as the phrase is, and of course that is
perfectly fair. 1 am not intimating that ho
does not. But there are fighters who use the
elbow in this way and they should never be al
low >d to win by it. A good referee can tell
whether a punch with the elbow is accidental or
not.
Low hitting should always be watehed. The
Birmingham biow is an ugly foul. It is a
swinging up cut, ostensibly for the pit of the
stomach out really aimed low. The referee, if
be knows anything about boxing, can readily
detect this sort of work, and he ahould stop it
right away .'I here's nothing in this style of hit
t ng, and If a m«n who knows better uses it, he is
trying to foul. A man whocommits a deliberate
foul is a coward. He wants to quit. If 1 am
referee I'll please him bv letting him quit, for
I'll decide arruir.st him as soon us his intentions
are revealed.
fn elosing I wish to say a word about profes
sionalism in the amateur ratiks. It seems to me
that the best way to get rid of the evil would be
to form au amateur butting ltagu<» of America.
Tie Amateur Athletic I'mon is handling too
inu-h. ■« itn its outdoor w-orts and other vari»-
ties of athletics. Boxing gives opportunities
enough for an orgaaizaJou devoted to that
alone. The entries iu contest# should be lim

Female Pugilist Knocks Out & Man.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 2.—The local sporting
frateraity is much puzzled over the re«uit of a
peculiar prizefight, news of which leaded out
today. It occurred yesterday mornia? at the
rot.dhou-e of Sim Coy. the notorious Demo

the i rir.cipa s was Patrii g McMahon, who has
some reputation as a feather-weight pugilist,
but the m"re interestiag of the two was a
woman, whose identity is not revetied, but
who is thought to be the wife of n r iilro.nl con
ductor oa the Big Four. She wa« dressed in
tights aad short skirts nud tipped the beara at
pounds. The matter was kept very quiet,
aad only about two dozen "sport*" were ad
mitted. Sevea bloody rouads were fought, in
each of which the woman had the best of it.
Wheu the seveath was finished both w<--re ia
such bad coadition that a half hour a time iiad
to be given. Two more rouads were fought
The aiath ended with McMahon stretched upon
the floor, knocked out by a heavy blow from the
smazon i left upon his neck, the was awarded
a purse of s.'>oo.

New York Letter.
I dropped into the office of Mr. Duval,
the genial secretary of Chauncey M. De
pew, the other morning, and while there
was given a glimpse of some of the queer
letters which daily pour into the office, the
majority of which. I atn pleased to say,
never reach the desk of the president of
the great New York Central. One letter
particularly struck nie. It was that of a
gentleman who anonymously informed
Mr. Dcpew that he was a fraud and a
greatiy overestimated man. "This fellow,"
said Mr. Duval, "writes a letter to Mr. De
pew every time he sees a reference to one
of Mr. Depew's speeches or addresses in a
newspaper. His mission seem* to be to
prevent Mr. Depew from ever thinking
well of himself. He has wasted enough
postage stamps in five year* to buv him
self a suit of clothes, and still Mr. I)epew
goes right on making speeches. Some
times his criticisms are amusing. Often
they are coarse and insolent." It is to be
hoped that this crank's hostility to
Chauncey will not assume the bomb
slinging phase.

PORTLAND, Jan. 2, H. T. Hudson, president of
the Portland Baseball Clnb and va-e president
of the Northwest L ague, is displeased
■with the negotiations for Ciu:« Nidation
with the California League. He says
no on® has been authorized to
negotiate for conso .iation. He is a'» 1 dis
plea-e i with the 50 i>er cent, basis. Portland,
he say«, would 1 ave to support the sma ler
towr.s in t'r.e Northwest, t' e same as San Fran
cisco would have to support the California
town*.
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 2. —The consolidation of
tbe California u4 Pacific Northwest leaguaa
on the piun outlined on Thursday appears to be
assured. The managers at the meeting on
1 hursdsy night decided to pool issues, and all
that remain* in the way of accomplishes the
anialg tmatiou is the expense of transporting the
players. The draft of a schedule prepared
by Manairer Harris was satisfactory to all
parties concerned, and will probably be
adopted. Colonel Robinson, who some time
ago announced himself to be in favor of jotniug
the two leagues, is now naturally opposed to
the scheme, as under the new order oi things
the Oakland club has been frozen out.
Rolinson disapproves of the idea to shut up
the Haight street grounds during the absence of
the San Francisco club. He advocates an eight
club league, and thinks that the Oakland club
shou'.d bo played at the local grounds while
the San Fraucisco team is away from home. He
said: "As for dropping the Oakland* from the
league, I will not stand it" It will be interest
ing to know how Robinson proposes to force
the league into retaining the town across the
bay. He would not even have redress in the
courts. The California league is an organiza
tion that expires every year. In January the
managers form a co-partnership for twelve
months, and at the expiration of that time a
majority of the members may make any com
bination they see fit. Oney Patton, of Portland,
shortstop, leaves for the East today to atteud
the funerai of his brother, who died recently.

night they still wore the red and white rosettes
which was a part of the liberal display of Mult

stain pod them a* gentlemanly young fellows,
with a justifiable enthusiasm on behalf of their
athletic club and especially for their representa

Allof the men united ia denouncing the re
ports of brutal play by the Portland team,
which were printed in the Tacoma papers anl
also sent out in press dispatches. Their cham

experience and more thorough training for the
contest than that possessed by the Tacoma play
ers. The party consisted of 11. K. Judge, Ed

The shooting in the valleys of British

in the winter of IS**, between si* ani
eight tons of deerskins were shipped
by local traders, the result of legi;i: iafo

are as ;hey were when the white men tirst
saw them, and though the beaver and sea
otter, the marten, and those f .xcs w.i s«

to their distances, their heights, and rs to
all else concerning which a rareiied utraos*
pliere can hocuspocus a stranger. T lere
is one animal, king of ail the beasts,
which the most unaspiring hunter may
chance upon, as well as the bravest, and
that animal carries a perpetual chip upon
its shoulder, and seldom turns from an en
counter. It is the grizzly bear. It is his
presence that gives you either zest <>r
pause, as you may decide, in hunting all
the others that roam the mountains. Vet,
in that hunter's dreamland it is the grizzly
that attracts many sportsmen everv year.
From the headquarters of the Hudson
Bay Company in Victoria, I obtained the
list of animals in v\ hose skints that com*
pany trades at that station. It makes a
formidable catalogue of zoological pro*
ducts, and is as follows: Bears (brown,
black, grizzly), beaver, badger, foxes (sil
ver, cross and red), lishers, martens, minks,
lynxes, musk-rat, otter (sea or land),
panther, raccoon, wolves (black, gray and
coyote), bI.K k-tailed deer, starts (a true
sta<r, growing to the size of an ox, and
found on the hills of Vancouver island),
caribou or reindeer, hares, mountain goat,
big horn (or mountain sheep), moose(near
the Rockies), wood butlalo (found in the
North, not greatly different from the bi
son, but larger), ge.-se, swans and duck.
