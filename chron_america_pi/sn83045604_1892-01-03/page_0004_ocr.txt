TFIE DOLL A K OF OCR rATHER*.
At the end of the la»t eeatnrythe srold
d ar was ia actual use under the doab e
■'an tard of 15 to L This gold dollar grmd
ual'y disipp=«ared and the silver dollar
took its place. In 1534, although the mint
wa« coining gold regularly, it was only
t ned for exportation, not a gold piece
was to be fea ia circulation, and the di-
of the mint had informed congress
that the gold deposited for coinage was
there till a packet was readv to sail to
Europe, when it was taken direct on ship
board.
In order to stop this Sight of ro'.d con
f-e-s. in adopted the ratio of 16 to 1,
si though well aware that the true com
mercial ratio was aNoat 15.70.
in their anxiety to enve out con
gr- «s drove out their small change alor.g
with their sliver dollars, so that for
twenty yars their srnaii money consisted
of miscellaneous ioreign coins, which
parted at tb*ir bullion value.
In 1»">5 congress passed tbe legislation
necessary to fum.sh us with sufficient
•mall si.ver rr c.ney or change of our own
cr nage, but "the dollar of our fatners,"
■whi'l'i the silver lunatic sort am about,
*as in l.- U the gold do.lar, for tbe silver
c lar our fathers never saw. The dollar
o our grandfathers was the silver dollar,
a - d they passed the act ol 1534 in order to
get ri iof it. So much for the ignorant
rant concerning "the dollar of our fathers."
MJMfcUH EGAX AND CHILZ.
The probability is that tbe statements
of the London n»wspar*rs that Minister
Esran has made himself offensive to the
Chi.ean government are without founda
tion. f' r no nation tolerates the presence
cf a foreign minister an hour after bis
j resence has become personally d.sarree
a ie. Our roTerament caused the reca.l
©f the Russian minister, Catacazy; George
Washington dismissed Genet, tbe minister
cf the French republic; Russia declined
cn personal grounds to receive Stratford
Canning; Ausirta, in ls6l, declined to re
t«vs Bur.inrame, and in 13*5 refused
Ke ley, and China the other day
declined Blair. Carl Schaxx once
could have had the Berlin mission,
bat bad to decline it because Prussia
intimated that his appointment would
cot be acceptable, as he was an escaped po
litical exile from Baden in 1»49. We sent
passports to Cramptoa, the British min
ister, during tbe Crimean war, for med
dling with our neutrality laws, and Bay.
ard gave Lord Sackriile his passports for
writing a letter that appeared to reflect
Upon President Cleveland.
Of course, Chils would not fear to ex*
erciae a priv. ege that China has not hesi
tated to avail itself of, and it is fair to as
sume that Minister Ecan is not offensive
to Chile or he woul l have been given his
passports; it is fa r to assume that he has
been courteously treated by the Chilean
g verr :nent, or he would have gone home,

JOHN C. HAINES.
To »»▼ that Colonel Haines is dead is to
pay that a tower is is.", em To the people
of tl* s city and of tr. 1* stare he stood a
monument of rsgred strength, physical
and mental. For Lis work a* a ia-vrer, as
a citizen, as a man of pab.ic atlairs, he
was equipr-ed in complete armor. l_k? a
knight of old, and t ie weapons he bore
were of matchless strength ar.d keenness.
To those *ho knew Colonel Hales
merely as a pnblie man bis mem
ory is of strength, vlgsr and readi
ness. To those who knew tiim
as a ess it is a.i this, but it is mora. It is
a merro-y of generos.ty. frankness ani
hon«*sty of purpose. Few men indyirg
leave behind them so many who really
loved him. Those who knew him well
!*vei him because malice Lai no place in
his composition. He was incapable of
doing, or of thinking of doing, a mean act.
He wa? a res lute foe, but when his antag
onist offered tbe hand of friendship .t wii
a. ways accepted, and tnen ani there the
coniiict 1
Since Colonel Haines has lived in
Seattle he has been the foremost
n an of the city and of the commonwealth.
In a:! public affairs he has taken an active
and a leading part. As an officer of the
National Guard, as a member of the Re
pu: -loan party, as an active worker in the
thousand and one public matters that
claimed h.s attention, bis induence was
powerful and lastins, and, so lonr as the
commonwealth of Washington exists, his
life work will be unforgotten.
It is bard, indeed, to realize that this
magnificent man is no more. It is hard
to realize that this intellect, so profound
and so etron?, has yielded its last fruit.
It is hard to realize this kindly heart
has been moved by its last generous im
pulse. It is hard to res'.lze that to those
who knew John C, Haines as h« really
was. there remains only a sweet and ten
der memory, which will linser until the
last of those who loved him have followed
him into the silent land.
It is hard to say farewell to this strong,
generous and lovable man.
DO WI GROW WORSST
The question, "Do we grow worse?" is
naturally asked with the beginning of the
New Year as we look back upon the Siirht
of the old year. Pessimistic philosophers,
who have been accurately defined as per
sons of more brains than soul, with a bad
liver and a worse heart, always argue that
the world grows worse rather than better
with the lapse of time.
Tested by facts and figures the world of
today is a far better, brighter and purer
realm than it was in the days of the
founders of the Republic. The study of
the struggle of the American colonists for
independence makes it clear that the men
of 1776 were relatively no better, no
more patriotic, no purer in tbe
mass than the men of 1%"1 who
lought for the fiag and founded a nation
at Appomattox. Washington was not a
purer, wiser or more unselfish a patriot
than Lincoln; Greene and Wayne were not
stouter or more sincrle-hearted soldiers
than Grant and Sheridan. Samuel Adams
and John A isms were instinct with no
more fiery enthusiasm an d lofty zeai for
the cause than Govern r Andrew or Sec
retary Stanton; John Hancock and Robert
Morris did not «j»end their money for the
cause more freely than did General Wads
worth h;s fortune for the Union. Th -re
was rt latively as much dishonesty, corrup
tion, cowardice ani disloyalty behind the
Continental as behind the Union army.
Families were divided into Tori »s and pa
tri ts then, as families in our struggle were
divided into Ini n men and copper
heads. Thirty thousand tories sailed
from New York city in cast
their faith and their fate with
the British ilag and settled in the marl
time provinces of Car-da and Ontnrio.
Benjamin Frank in left h.s s >n little prop
erty by his wiil because t e son was a bit
ter New Jersey tory. The torv Butler,
* so wasted Cherry valley ; - 1 Wvc: ing
with fire and sword, was as fe-roci- us and
cruel as Quantrell. who sacked Lawrence,
Kansas. The barbarities of the Brit.sh
prisons in New York city were as ba 1 as
those indicted in the exceptional in
stance of Andersonvllle. Washing
ton's army was constantly depleted
by desertion. It was cursed bv
thieving contractors and swindlers, as sel
fisn a id the general woe a* th «<e o; our
own day. who cried when the rebellion
wo.s crushed, because the*e was no longer
ary carcass for the turkey buzzard con
tractor to feed upm. a-- j no longer any
market f r the mi itary broker in the hu
man :!eih of substitutes. Maraullr sr was
so common to both armies that New Jep
sey was overran with rival guerrillas, iu-t
as Missouri *as in our civil war, who
robbed and murdered ea h ether w.:h
hearty pood *lll, aid when they could ri t
roh a fo>? were not soueamish about robbing
their own tide. Washington had such a
lot of villainous men in his army at Cam
bridge that he wrote letters of absolute
despair of the issue of the contest. The
British flooded the country with counter
feit Continental money, and found no . f
ficu'ty in getting plenty of base Americans
to shove it.
1 e correspondence, records and private
documents of those days show that there
a la--ean i popul us under world dur
ing the ;icvv Intionary period, "a world of
sharpers and whipping posts, of drunken
tavern keepers atid loose women." The
Country was so demoralized dur.ng the
war that eve-y hit of w v>J w;is a lurking

In the matter of re-igion the upper
cla?sT-s were a* much permeated with in
difference as at pre-sent. Ia Richmond,

p.ored the naxaber of rained churcuea in
Virginia.
Xae held of polities is pnrer today ia
both and America than it was
110 years ar3. Br.hery at elections is as
od as 159 B. C., when Rome punished
br. he-givers by exile. The Roman law
subsequently construed giving the people
a van .4set or a rla l.att ria. show as a tribe.
Bribery w*» a common prat.ee with conits
and juries under H.-nry VIIL Wnen Lord
Bacon was oisgraced for bribe taking un
der James tr.e First, he p.eaded that ;t
was theenrtom; he simp.y conformed to
the nn versii pract.ce of the judiciary.
Political br.hery became an organized sys
tern under Charles the Second. In tne
time cf George the Second his great min
ister, Sir Robert Wa.po.e, declared that
every man had his price. Tae father cf
the g-eat English statesman. Fox. was
conspicuous for his peculations and for
h.s corrupt employment of ihe money he
was a.»owed to steal. The correction
practiced under the .eaiership of the Duse
of Newcajt.e was notorious. Ia leo 7 tne
election expenses of William Wilberforce,
the purest parliamentary figure of hj
time, were fc>/\OOQ.
The uiarv of John Adams describes the
horrid rancor of tne press, and the terrible
hate between men of different parties, to
the point that famii es were divided for life;
men cut each other in tne street. Ham
ilton cied in a duel; so did his son: so did
several New York editors of that day.
Hamilton was a great man, but as a moral
figure in po.itics he was full of s-rious
blemishes. James Caliender, in a pam
phlet, called Washington "a traitor, a
rot-be r and a perjurer," and John
Adams "a hoary-beaded incendiary," and
Callender further declare! that for this
pamphlet Jefferson paid him SIOO. Wash
ington was bitterly revi.ed in his coffin by
the hostile press. From 1753 to Jackson's
day the public press was full of rancor and
political obscenity beyond anything in our
own day, but the worst and meanest of
this indecency was from IT?9 to 180 L The
ballot-boxes were stolen in Ulster county,
New York, in the days when George and
PeWitt C.inton ruled the JeHerson party,
and the unpublished correspondence of
Chancellor Kent from 1790 to IMS is full of
ahusions to rascality, duplicity and vil
lainy in politic* and greed for office on the
part of men of the highest historical reputa
tion. De Witt Clinton was a duellist, and a
most obscene nliher of Martin Van Buren.
T:.e times of Washington, both before and
after the revolution, were not comparable
with our own in the general prevalence of
patriotism, religion, political purity and
social morality. Here is a passage which
Nathaniel Hawthorne was inspired to
write by reading some old colonial news
papers.
There is no evidence that ths moral itaniard
was higher then Uan BOW; or, indeed, that
morality was so well defined as it haa since be
come. Ifce pillory, tbe whipping rost, th*
pri»oa aid the gallows ea-a tad their use ia
th.-«e o'.d time*: and. in short, as often it oar
imagination lives in the past, we find it a ruder
and roomer see th«n onr own. w;*.a tard.y any
perceptible advantages, and much that giT*
ii:e a glocmier tinge.
An avalanche of dirt was poured upon
Jackson's family life; he was caricatured
as a hangman, aui Jefferson was accused
of havinc a negro mistress, and the pair
were caricatured in the political prints as
"LongTcmani DuskvSal." Washington
was charred with bavin? made money by
corrupt real estate speculation in Wash
ington City during his iast term of o:*oe.
At President Jackson's public receptions
whisky was served to everybody that
wante i it. When Governor Seward was in
augurated at Albany. New York, in l s o9
he, li-e Governor Hill cf cur day. gave a
great banquet whirh four thousand to rive
thousand people turned into a drunken
CSTMSS so violent that the superin
tendents of the feast were obliged to
call in the civil authorities.
These facts go to ehew that the charge
of the political pessimists and clerical
croakers of the hour that we have fallen
a ay fright?—y fr:.m the put lie opinion
of the days when the fathers of
the repu L :c ruled our polit cs, hns
no historical foundation. Our polit
ical manners, methods and morals
are far le«s bar bar -us than they were in
those "go'd old days." when political
h-.-tility precipitated duels, alienated the
closes: frien is in society, business and re-
HgiOß, when bitos refused to sreak to
sons and no s vial ties of blood were
strong enough to resist the pressure of
pc ti a! hates. The c croa«.er« of to
dy uj tit sc "ii t c. uipreiiend that ths
people cf t.- ay are far in advance of those
of a century aro in aevotion to
m -.ral and religiousprinc - l>s. They need
to be reminded that the great Methodist
preacher, Wh.tSeld, t?ll his friends in
England that in the American colon'es
1: ent; >usne«s seemed to be universa.. and
there is overwhelming testimony that the
tippling habit was common among the
clergy, intoxication sometimes seen in
" " P-ilpit and the free consumption cf
ardent spirits at funerals universal
m Niw Eng and among the moat pious
ar.d respectable clashes. The sincere,
h r.e?: orthodox bigot always preaches a
h p. «s. pessimistic view of humanitv
and h #t.-ry, because he has been educated
to a. i the doctrine of tota. depravitv
and eternal, inexorable pun.sbment; and
t .e dishonest pulpit preaches
p« nvsm, because without :t he cannot
be sensational; without it he would con
tess that the world can get bravely on
even if such preachers of hopelessness in
t*"s w rid and damnation and despair iu
the next should eet out.
