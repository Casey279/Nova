and Enriched Him.
PESYER, Jan. 2.—This morning, in the
Graves case, Judge Furman resumed:
I appreciate the anxiety of the court and yenr
seif to get through with the ca*e, and X will
condense my remarks aa cloteiy as possible. I
am going to refresh your memory. Conrnd de
nied positively that he said to Dr. Grave* thnt if
he could go back to his family and explain
everything would be all right Hanscoa ad
mitted that he did say this. Conrad denied
that he and Oraves quarreled. Hanscoa ad
mitted that hb thought Graves had loud and
atormy wordi with Conrad on one of the nights,
tioea thli not sustain Mr. Graves? Dr. Graves
did rerpond about the guardian letter. It was
cot to hang aay one, but to rurb Mrs. Raraaby's
extravagance. They say Dr. Graves' motive
was to be made executor without bond. They
prove by John Conrad that Dr. Graven told h.m
that he said he thought Mrs. Bsmnby remem
bered Conrad's children In the will, but he did
cot know what amount he was left himself.
Yet they say he had a motive because ho had
himself made pole executor, lie did not know
he bad been made aole executor until Jim Con
rad told him.
The case went to the jury at 4p. m. At
10:15 p. m. the jary returne 1 a verdict of
guilty of murder in the first degree.
Dr. Graves was sitting behind his attor
ney, Judge Furraan, when the verdict was
read. lie jjave a violent start, almost
leaping from his chair. Perspiration in
stantly started, end great drops of sweat
came from his forehead. He then covered
his lace with his hands and was silent.
His attorney, Furman, took the ver
dict equally a< hard, and actually
shed tears. The judge asked Furman if
he desired the jury polled, and the latter
savagely replied "No," but made a motion
for a new trial. When Dr. Graves was
esked what ho thought of the ver
dict, he said repeatedly that it
was a great shock and surprise to
him. In a short time bailiffs took
Graves to a carriage and he was driven to
jail. Colonel Ballou and Judge Furman
accompanied him. Mrs. Graves and his
aged mother were not present at the court
when the verdict was rendered, but after
ward went to the jail to see him. They
were greatly affected bv the news, and the
doctor's mother fainted.
{ln April, IKU, the country was startled by
the relation In the newspapers of a crime which
had evidently be a eureiully plannud and de
liberately executed. It was tho poisoning of
the widow of J. B. Barnahy, who had been a
w.;ll-known merchant of Boston and Provi
dence, and who, on his decease, left a fortune,
a portion of which Mr». Barnaby secured in the
settlement of the affairs of tho estate.
Tho man charged with tho poisoning
of Mrs. Bunaby la Dr. T. Thatcher
Grave*, A Harvard graduate, a prominent
•haractor of Providence and a well known G. A.
It. member, lheatory of the crime ia as fol
lows:
Far away on the east coast In the staid New
England town of Providence the murder was
planted and it" consummation arranged so far
as even the purchase of tell-taie 16 cent stamps,
which paid the postage on the novel missive of
death. Mailed in Boston and destined for Den
ver, It hit the mark with terrible accuracy.
On June 2S last, when Mrs. Barnaby arrived at
the mountain home of Kdward Bennett in the
Adirondacks, tt seemed almost impossible for
auch a sequel to follow Perhaps her life had
not been all that the ldaal wife and woman
mleht desire. Family discord is admitted, and
of no trivial nature. The dead millionaire—her
husband—had cut her off In his will with a
paltry $2,600: but that had been settled without
pushing the matter to trial in the courts. After
all she was sti'.l handsome and rich, able to
satisfy all her fada and fancies and
travel «• much as she desired, lier old-tiuie
friend, the handsome Providence physician, no
longer held the lofty place in her estimation
that he had dona Miss Handlcy, her maid, was
openly accnaed by her of being a spy, paid by
the doctor to keep a close watch. lie had a mya-
Ut lone p jwer over her, and site was cosequent'y
n.rnd of him. Dr. Graves at all hazards must
retain his h >ldon Mrs. Barnaby, and so he kept
n watch through the young; girl, whom he
ahd placed In the position she held. It was not
a lion of trust, for her mistress knew too
wel: why a compauion was aiways at her side,
Jel she was afraid to dismiss her. 8o the fall

c.uf any open act of hostility between these corn

the wiatur the peace waa retained. As

Train Bobber Sly Identified.
ST. LOCIS, Jan. 2.—A. I). Sly, the al
leged Giendale train robber, was today ab
solutely identified by a salesman in a local
furniture house as the purchaser of
the lurniture for the Swan avenue
house where the detectives got a
clue. Express Messenger Mulrennan was
later brought face to face with Sly, and as
serted that he was the man who held the
pistol to his head, took his watch and
directed the operations of the other men
in the car. Sly showed signs of
nervousness at sight of Mulrennan, but
resolutely persisted in no knowledge of
the all'air. The engineer and fireman of
the train which was robbed picked Sly out
of five men as the man who was on the
tender of the engine on the night of the
robbery.
SAN FRASCISCO, Jan. 2. —The police have
been unable to gain any information from
the woman arrested in Oakland as an ac
complice of Sly and Iledspeth, the Glen

silence.

was passing through the apartment where
Frierson was located. He had gone after
him to remove him to the place where the
death watch could guard him, when the
murderer, who was a powerful negro,
grasped the officer by the throat, and a
terrible struggle followed, the murderer
trying to get the jailer's revolver. When
assistance finally reached the jailer his
face was livid and he was almost exhaust
ed. The jailer's assistant knocked Frier
son senseless with the butt end of a re
volver.

GREAT FIKE AT NASHVILI.E.
Three Men Killed antl SOOO,OOO Worth
of Business Property .Destroyed.J
NASHVILLE, Jan. 2. —Today at 5:40 p. m.
most disastrous tire Nashville has had
since broke out in Webb, Stevenson »fc
CO.'B store on College street. A strong
wind was blowing from the northwest.
The fire was conlined to this store for
nearly an hour, but gradually found its
way into the adjoining store, occupied
by A. (3. Rhodes & Co., and then in Atwell
& Snecd's. At this time the wind changed
and the ure started in another direction,
and Weakly & Warren's seven-story
furniture store, north of Webb, Steven
son it Co. 's was soon a mass of
ilarnes. Members of a colored fire com
pany were standing across the alley on the
three-story building of the Phillips &
Butfrof Manufacturing Company, when
Weakly 6c Warren's building suddenly
bulged out in the center and fell across the
alley.
The following firemen, all colored, were
caught under the falling building and in
stantly killed: Aaron Cockreil, John
A ten, Harvey Ewing and Captain Goudy.
When tiie Phillips <£ Butterof bunding
crushed in it quickly took I.re and was
consumed. About this time the wind
change 1 ;iga ; n ami the flames swept back
toward the Noel block, and a vacant build
ing adjoining Atweil & Sneed's soon
burned. The Noel block then
caught tire, and at this hour (11 p.
m.) is in ruius. The tire is
now practically under control. There were
a number of men injured by falling wai is
and explosions that blew out the walls of
two or three stores. It is supposed the
fin* was of incendiary origin, as Fireman
I»iilv, while in the Atwell & Sneed build
ing, saw a man apply a torch to a mas 3 of
intlaramable material in the rear of the
store.
The loss will approach $<"X),000. It is
impossible to learn the insurance tonight.
The Phillip* & Putterof Company lose
160,000; A. J. Warren, $96,000; Webb,
Stevenson A Co., $15,"""; Atweil »t Sneed,
$3o,000; A. G. Rhodes Co.,
J \OA), and the building occupied by the
three later firms s7o,<n->. The Xoel block
was occupied by the Western Union ltle
grsph Company, and contained about
f.fty offices and bedrooms. The build
ing cost $70,0»>, and the Western
Union's loss is SIO,OOO. Several
firms suffered considerable damage by
water and broken window eia*«. It is
difficult to get information out of the city
on account of the destru lion of the Wct

Drowned in Crossing.
THE DEEP CREEK MILL BURNED.
Oregon Hnntcr Killa Himself— Brak
eman I>ecapitated at Salem—Steam
boat Fireman Drowned.
VICTORIA, Jan. 2.—[Special.]—lt is now
certain that a disaster cutting short the
lives of ten Chinamen and two women
has happened m the straits that separate
this city from the American side. Last
Saturday night a small sloop left E*qui
malt harbor, containing four notorious
Chinese smugglers, who have been con
nected with the traffic fgr four years here,
six native coolies, who have been kept
here for some weeks since their arrival
from China awaiting a favorable oppor
tunity to get them across to Port Town
send, and two young girls, who arrived on
the Empress of China from Hongkong in
September last. These latter were aged
19 and 13 and were bought in Victoria for
$l,lOO and $1,300 respectively, the fact of
this barter being exposed fully in the
Colonist at the time, and several promin
ent Chinese merchants being implicated
in the scheme. Since the sloop left noth
ing has been heard of her, and after the
heavy storms in the straits during the
pa«t few days there is little possibility of
their being safe.
This afternoon a fisherman, about six
miles down the coast, picked up an oar,
rudder and mast on the beach near his
hut, which have been identitied by the
friends of the smugglers as belonging to
the sloop.

France Tries in Tain to Form
Anti-German Combination.
A GERMAN CATHOLIC VICTORY.
The Csarina Rick From Worrying Orer
Conspiracies—lrish Official* Fear a
Revival of Kenianiim.
BERLIN, Jan. 2. —The French govern
ment is too late in trying to meet the
dreihund's zollverein by commercial
alliance with various European states.
The overtures made from l'aris
to Sweden, Denmark, Greece and
Italy are perfectly known in Berlin.
These overtures till now have resulted
in nothing further than an agree
ment with Greece and Denmark, both
ol these allies of Russia getting a min
imum French tariff in exchange lor
"favored nation" treatment to France.
The negotiations for a treaty with Italy
have ceased. With Sweden France stands
a better chance, but nothing the Paris gov
ernment can do now can weaken the drei
bund's zollverein, which ere long will in
clude Belgium, Holland, Roumania and
Servia, and probably Spain.
Rumors are current that negotiations
are pending to obtain the adhesion of Rus
sia to a commercial convention, but there
is no foundation for them.
Among the new year's articles appear
ing in the German press is one in the
National Ze.tung which specially com
ments on the growth of the American
Union as the decisive factor of the century.
PARIS, Jan. 2.—The Temps says the gov
ernment is on the eve of concluding a con
vention with the United States for the par
tial application of a minimum tariff. This
agreement, the Temps says, differs -from
those pending between France and some
other European powers, in requiring that
it shall he submitted to parliament
for ratification. The new convention,
the Temps adds, secures continuance on
the American free list of a number of
French products, including skins, sugars
and molasses. The paper further says
that President Harrison intended on
January 1 to enforce asrainst
these products the duties applicable
to imports from countries that have re
fused to concede to the United States
reciprocal advantages. To secure the un
broken enjoyment of exemption from the
payment of those duties, M. Ribot, minister
of foreign affairs, negotiated the convention
referred to, by the terms of which the
United States gets a minimum tariff" on
products entering France, the export
value of which amounts to 12,000,000
francs, and which equal in value the
French products exempted from duty by
the United States.
MADRID, Jan. 2.—The new tarriff doubles
the duty on coal and petroleum, and
augments from 50 to 150 per
cent, the duties on cotton, woolen,
tin and silk goods. An equally
heavy increase has been made in the duties
on iron and copper goods, cutlery, ma
chinery, tea, coffee, breadstuff's, wines and
liquors. The duty on alcohol is 100 pesetas
per hectolitre.
PARIS, Jan. 2. —The Official Gazette will
tomorrow publish a decree issued by the
government announcing that Boulogne
will hereafter be open to the admission of
salt pork from the United States.
TIIE MAHDI LOSING 1119 GRIP.
He Neglects Ills Family, and Hal Let
Khartoum Go to Ruin.
LONDON, Jan. 2. —Telegrams have been
received here from the Congo which con
firm the statements made by Father
Orhwabler. He said that forty Europeans
were still in the hands of the Mahdists
in Omdurman. They are loaded
with manacles and cruelly beaten.
In telling the mode of living while in
captivity, the father said the Mahdi
granted no provision for the subsistence
of the captives, but allowed them sufficient
liberty to earn a living as best they could.
Father Ohrwalder lived by tailoring
and weaving, and the sisters
by baking and selling- bread.
During the last ten months the fugitives
had lived in mud huts, but previously
their only shelter was made with their
own hands from canes and maize stalks.
They describe Khartoum as all destroyed
excepting only the Austrian church
and General Gordon's palace, and vegeta
tion is covering the sites of the houses.
During two years famine and smallpox
made severe ravages in the Soudan. Maize
rose to ten times its normal value
but now food is plentiful and
cheap. Today's advices from the Congo
corroborate Father Ohrwalder's report of
the waning power of the dervishes in the
southwestern part of the Soudan. They
state that frequent conflicts have occurred
between the Mahdists and native chiefs,
and the latter have been often victorious.
Father Ohrwalder and the sisters trav
eled direct from Korosko to Cairo, and a
dispatch received from the last named
city stated that the priest, in speaking of
affairs in the Soudan, had said the
numerous widows of Mahdi are com
plaining that Khaiif Abdailah
does not provide them with
maintenance befitting their station, and
their grievance has been supported by
Kha'.if Sherif. The latter also opposes
Abdallah's scheme of making the Mahdi's
succession hereditary, instead ot elective,
as provided for by Mohammed. These
dissensions are weakening the power of
the Mahdi, and Father Ohrwalder says
the people would welcome any change to
relieve them from its tyranny.
FENIAN SCAKE IN IUELAND.
A Bomb Caused Dublin Castle Ezplo.
Bion P.*!;Eag« Closely Inspected.
DrBMN, Jan. 2.—The theory that the
explosion at Dublin castle was of gas was
effectually disposed of today. Those
making an investigation, in examining
the beams supporting the door directly
over the cellar where the explosion oc
curred, found a number of small pieces of
metal deeply imbedded in tfce timbers.
This is evidence beyond question that the
explosive, whatever it may have been, was
inclosed in a metal case. The investiga
tion is still going on, and the police hope
it will reveal some clue that will lead to
the detection of the perpetrators of the
outrage.
Since the explosion in the castle Thurs
day last, the police have been vigilant in
watching for the suspected dynamiters.
The customs officers, too, have developed
extra activity in searching the effects of
passengers landing at Qucon»town irom
transatlantic steamers. They always
made it a point to seize under law any
arms or ammunition brought into the
country by either residents or foreigners,
but since Thursday's affair they are stricter
than ever. Thomas Ryan, a United States
pensioner, who was a pas>enger on
the Cunard steamer Ktraria, which ar
rive 1 at Queenstow n. was taken intocus
lody on the charge of concealing a loaded
revolver and a supply of ammunition.
Another French liUhop Violate* the Law.
PARIS. Jan. 2.—A CN«E somewhat similar
to that of the archbishop of Aix has arisen
between the government and the
bishop of C&rcassone. The order is
sued by the government at the time ot the
fantheoa incident, for bidding i'reneh
bishops to leave their dioceses without
permission from the minister of justice
and public worship, is still in force, it
was this rule tho archbishop of Aix vio
lated, and the bishop of Carcassone also
refused to obey and recently went to
Home. In consequence the minister of
justice has suppressed the bishop's stipend
for the period of absence from his see.
The bishop asserts that he went to Rome
merely in fulfilment of a spiritual duty,
as he had done in previous years. It is
not known what action the government
will take, but to be consistent it will have
to prosecute him as it did the archbishop
of Aix.
Emptrnr William'* New Year'*.
BERLIN, Jan. 2.— [Special.] —Bleak winds
and drenching rains ushered in the new
year. Such miserable weather, of course,
had some effect on the coloration of the
day. The court functions were the same
as usual. At the levee, where all the com
manding generals, government officials
and court officers filed past the throne,
the emperor wore the gala uniform of a
Prussian general with the ribbon of the
Order of the Biack Eagle. The empress was
attired in a magnilicent court robe. She
also wore the ribbon of the Black Eagle
and the decorations of many other orders.
At noon the emperor rode to the arsenal
to perform the usual New Year's cere
mony of giving parole to the
troops. Everybody here expected
him to make important utterances
on this occasion, but he said nothing be
yond a few words in addressing a group
of officers. He advised them to speedily
acquire knowledge of the power and use
of the latest military improvements.
German Catholics Obtain Concessions.
BERLIN, Jan. 2.—For the solid vote of
the Centrists in the reichstag, which en
abled the government to pass tiie commer
cial treaties, that party is about to obtain
the long desired concession granting the
clergy greater control of instruction in
primary schools. Count von Zedlitz, min
ister of public worship, will submit to the
landtag a project conferring power on the
clergy to examine candidates for teacher
ship on religious questions. The Catho
lics regard the concession as one which
will enable the clergy to control the
schools through the teachers. The pro
ject will cause a bitter tight in the land
tag, as the Conservatives hold it will
pervert the character of the volks-schule.
Should Not Ketnrn to Germany
BERLIN, Jan. 2. —The American legation
here is busy with the cases of American
citizens of German birth who have been
arrested in this country for desertion from
the army. American Mirrster Phelps linds
the government ready to accede to any
reasonable demand for the release of re
turned deserters, even when the laws per
mit of their reteution, but it would be bet
ter if men liable to prosecution on this
charge would remain in their adopted
country.
Russia at tlin World's Fair.
ST. PETERSBCKQ, Jan. 2. —Fourteen firms
of St. Petersburg have announced their
intention of sending exhibits to the
World's Columbian exhibition at
Chicago in 1393. Their exhibits
will consist chiefly of carriages,
jewelry, silver enameling, furs and spirits.
A society of Russian ladies who sent ex
hibits to the Moscow exhibition will send
to Chicago a collection of lace, fancy work,
and gold, silver and silk embroideries.
New riot Against the Czar.
BERLIN, Jan. 2.—Advices from St. Peters
burg are that the illness of the czarina is
low fever, partly due to worrying over a
plot against the czar, in which the highest
court and imperial personages are sus
pected. Private letters state that some of
these plots aimed at obtaining a constitu
tion by which the nobles and landholders
will appoint members of the assembly.
Kdbelliou in Morocco.
GIBRALTAR, Jan. 2. —Advices received
from Tangier, Morocco, report that tribes
in that neighborhood are in open rebellion
against the sultan. The reason for this is
thought to be the recent dismissal in dis
grace at Dez of all the Moroccan ministers
and court officials. A British gunboat
and cruiser have started from here to pro
tect British residents and interests in
Morocco.
American Aid for Knssia.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 2.—Hon. Charles
Emory Smith, United States minister to
Russia, has handed Rev. Mr. Francis,
pastor of the Anglo-American church in
this city, a large sum of money sub
scribed by Americans for the relief of the
famine sufferers. Among the subscrip
tions is one oi $1,400 from a Jewish syna
gogue in California.

search for them prevented. Richard Ilesse
and John Douglas left last Monday in
search of the Kline party, supposed to be
lost in the snow between I'lacervill© and

CITY OF MEXICO, Jan. 2.— The WTira ,
ment press insists that Garza is causing
no trouble. A crowd of excited peraonf
today entered the churches at Tezcom
sixteen miles from here, yelling "DfJ
to the church." Attacks were also m»d»
on the priests of the place.
AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 2.— [St. Louis

has received a dispatch from Captain
Neill, of the Bankers, announcing tht
arrival at Bio Grande City of himself tad
company of twenty men. McNeill re
ports a skirmish with Garza's ttc a
on the 21' th, and says ths ] J( ,
ter ran. General Maberry today
sent dispatches to Captain Maberry tad
Captain Brooks at Bio Grande City, in
structing them to look out for and protect
the interests of Texas, but not to mixap
in any international matters, and e*
pecially to learn the country and rotdi
and discover (iarza's stronghold.
There is a feeling here that the WOM!
has not come yet, and many think that
in less than forty days a general
rising will be witnessed in Mexiro
aeainst Diaz by the chnrch party.
The United States troops operatirj
in the jungles of the lower Rio Grande will
have to endure many hardships. No rtia
of consequence has fallen for thirteen
weeks, and it will not only be necessary to
carry all the supplies for men and beastj,
but even to haul water.
LABKDO, Tex., Jan. 2. —The arrival this
evening of two additional cavalry troopt
over tlie International road to take th«
held against Garza has aroused new inters
est in revolutionary matters. The saint
train brought several car load# of pacil
mules, said to have been sent by
the government from Wyoming. Th|
quartermaster's department has contracted
for a large number of Mexican ox-cartato
transport steers to the troops in the field.
A rumor, which is discredited, hai
reached here that Jose Sanchez, brother
of the guide who accompanied Captain
Hardie, was killed in a skirmish with
Garza's men yesterday. There are other
rumors to the effect that the state troops
had a tight with Garza's men in which
several were killed on both sides.
Inquiry today at Mexican military head
quarters failed to elicit anything in th#
way of news. They declare that every*
thing is quiet on their side of the river,
and that there is absolutely no foundation
for the report that General Garcia wai
killed at Mier, neither was there any
truth in the dispatches stating that thret
prisoners were snot in New Laredo thil
week. A large number of strange Mexi
cans have arrived here during thepait
twenty-four hours, and the impre*
sion prevails that they are a portioa
of Garza's men who have been diw
peraed by Captain Hardie's troops. Twcj
gentlemen who came in two days ago met!
a couple of Mexicans driving in an ambu-l
lance in the Encinal country, and froa
the description there is no doubt thatOM
of them is Garza himself.
Colonel Cameron, of the Mexican forces
in Nuevo Laredo, has received a teiegraia
from down the river on the Mexican side,
stating tnat a light has occurred on thil
side and that two T'nited States soldiert
have been killed. The.loss to the revolt
tionists is not given.
Colonel Ceron, of the Mexican array, re
iterates his denial of the revolt at Mier
and the killing of General Garcia. There
has been no demonstration on the Mexi
can side lor some time. Ail the people os
1» th sides of the river are in sympathy
with Garza, and it is impossible to get
any assistance looking toward bii
capture. It is said that the clerical party
is behind Carza, furnishing bim wits
money and that as soon as tie enlists 5,W
men they will furnish him millions to,
carry on his campaign. Neither Gan»
nor the main part of his followers are os
this side of the river. Ihey crossed
into the state of Tamau
lipas and are now in tin
mountains. The Mexican government
lias offered a reward of $300,000 for Garz*'
head. So far the Mexicans have kill"
over 100 men on suspicion of being
lutionists, and this has tended todri*s
the poor ranchers to join the revolt. Aj
Pueblo the populace has revolted tod
every priest has been placed in jail.
