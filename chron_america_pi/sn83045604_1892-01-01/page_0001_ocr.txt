cor. BILL'S FAREWELL
He Addresses a New Year's Eve
Feast at Albany.
WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD DO.
"Billion-Dollar Congress" Must Be
Constantly Held Up to People.
Various Rills, Such as Repeal of the
McKlnley Law and Sherman Silver
Law, Should Re Passed and Sent Up
to the Senate to Re Killed.
AX.BANT, N. Y., Dec. 31.—David B. Hill's
term as governor expired today, and the
event was marked by a dinner at which
Hili spoke his farewell to 150 per
sons, including state officials, Gover
nor-elect Flower and many prominent
state Democrats. He said, among other
things, that during the seven years he had
been in Albany there had been a constant
succession of victories for the Democracy,
until now the entire state government was
Democratic. Referring to his election to
the Senate, Governor Hill said:
My first emotion was that of every other Dem
ocrat, I suppo-e: Where and how cau he most
efficiently rend away power from that enormous
BKgregalioii of two centralized powers usurped
from the states, usurped from the people, the
h'<ieous, hugi progeny of the war debt and li
centious government partnership with pluto
crats of privilege-granted power.
Speaking upon the wisest course for the
Democracy to pursue in the present con
gress, Hiilsaid:
The overturning of the billion-dollar congress
by a popular uprising will not enable one new
line to b« written by the present congress in the
federal laws. The Republican*, though
quite as powerless as WJ are now to
pass new laws, can sit still and do nothing, yet
keep at lea*t till the 4ih of March, 1893, ail they
got by the acts of the billion-dollar congress and
the chance of saving their tariff for protec
tion's sake in place of a tariff for
revenue only, with protection inci
dental, saving their bounty and subsidy
principle and snvitig their reciprocity
humbug, which is but a scheme to extend stale
so- iaiisrn and substitute the restrictive bargains
of diplomats for the world-wide commerce of
freemen. Since any Democratic legisl.-.t.on pro
posed by the House is sure of defeat ia the
senate, there is to the House no wiser
course open than that the Democrats
shall first send up for defeat what will
cost the Republican party its final overthrow in
the next congressional and presidential elec
tions. Now, let us hold fast to the great facta
and pivot our policy on those. Here is one fact:
Democratic legislation by tbia Fifty-second
congress is quite impossible.
Another fact, and the largest fact
with which our great leadera iu con
gress have to take account, is that
the p oplj's verdict last year upon the
billion-dollar congress and all its work will be
come an utt.er nullity and empty wind unless
the i>eopl6 of the United States, unfooled, stick
t > their work, and again next November thunder
forth their just verdict.
■shall the people's verdict on the billion-dollar
congress have execution or uot? Shall the Demo
cratic party by keeping before the people the
billion-dollar congress issues of lfc9o, nothing
else and nothing less, keep before the people the
power to add to their verdict of 1890 its execu
tion in ls'J2? How can that best be done?
First—i J a>s no free coinage bill; pass only
needful appropriation bill* and enforce
economy.
Second—Grapple to undo the worst work of
tLe blUion-dol.ar C UKK-H; demand the rej>eal
oi the sherrnau silver law and the two McKiniey
laws.
THE characteristic feature of the present
political juncture is tnat by holding fast to
the issues undo by the billion-dollar
cougress during the canvase already pre
paring with great energy through
out the Union, the coincidences of
time, of public interest, of seuaiorial elections,
of the election of representatives and of the ex
ecutive, are such that the people's will, as de
c.ared a year ago, oa:i in one year more imme
diately and throughout prevaiL
In concluding Hill said:
New York will nut follow the lead of Nevada.
The New York Democrati care nothing for the
silver senators and their protected commodity.
The New York Democrats will never support
any federal money legislation that does not pro
mote the nation's return to the best mouey
ever known to mankind—namely, gold and sil
ver. the only legal tender, as Tilden's platform
said, and these united at a fix. d ratio in free
bi-metaiiic coinage with a paper currency,
which is a certificate of depositor either coin.
But the New York Democnts to a man, and
many an honest R pubi.can besides, will
follow Bland, chairmaa of the House
committee on coinage, with rested. admiration
and support, if ha will now lift the banner of
the repeal of the Sherman law, renewing for the
present the Bland law until the Democratic
party next November shall be commis ioneii to
undertake some better and Una! d.sposUion of
the who.e subject.
Gov.nior Hill's banquet ha» been the subje-1

Tines a fuw days a-o sa.d:

The Ohio Senatorial Fight.
CoiXMtics, 0., Dec. 3L—The senatorial flght
has now reached its hottest degree, and the
next few aays will witness one of the most
exciting conflict* that this stato has
ever experienced. Senator Sherman ar

once to his headquarters at the Neil house,
where the day w«- spent in meetin? the mem
bers of the legislature. The Sherman men claim
two to their ranks. It is now evi
dent that there will be a split in the Cuyahoca
delegation, which was counted solid for Sher
man. It is asserted that Koraker will get two of
their votes, and probably lour.

LANSING, Mich., Dec 31. —The committee ap
pointed to iuvest.grtte the conduct of ex-Secre
tary of State Sopsr made an exhaustive report
this morning, tiuding that Soper distrib
uted contrary to law 942 volumes cost
ing the state 11,013. He made purchaser of
furniture to the amount of s'.'2l, all of which is
declared as unnecessary and extravagant, but
there is practically no evidence showiug that he
profited personally by ttn.-se purchases or re
ceived any money for the distribution of
the books. There were but few letters
found showing that state funds had been
misappropriated. The committee says the
amounts misappropriated can never be deter
mined. The demand upou Rowley f«r $O(J0 was,
iu fact, made, but no examination was made aa
to whether it was the result of an agreement or
not. It is said there is nothing in the result of
the investigation upon which to base any prob
abley successful criminal prosecutions.

NASHVILLE. Tenn., Dec. 31.— A message from
Clark'Ville savs that the Frank in house and
several other buildings are on tire there an 1 that

the town seems doomed.
BAYONNE, N. J., Dec. 31.—The great barral
works of the Standard Oil Company at Con
stable Rock were burned down last night, aud
the loss is estimated at over $1,000,000.
The tire started at 9:30 last night
in the heatiug-room of the barrel
works. The Bavonne fire department quickly
responded to the alarm sent in. Over 500 men,
including the police and firemen, fought the
flames, but they soon found out that they
could not control them until the
entire plant and an immense amount of lumber
around it had been destroyed. Next to the bar
rel factory were chemical works, which were
saved a tei hard work. The building was filled
with barrels, both completed and unfinished,
ana about theV*structure, which was 350
feet long, -00 feet wide aud three
stories high, there were great stacks of cut lum
ber ready to be converted into barrels. The
machinery in the burnei building was value!
at over $200,000. The officers of the company
state that the entire loss is $5 w.OOO. The com
pany carries its own insurance.

Kmlnent Itussinus lioblifd In Chicago.
CHICAGO. Dec. 31. —Morning papers noted the
fact that two mysterious Russians stopping nt
one of the hotels registered simply as ' Naci

to an interviewer, and that ent- rprisln? young
man proceeded to hazard various conjectures,
finally concluding that they were either nihil
istic plotters who had escaped the Rush.an
secret police, or ehe members of the
latter body in search of a plotter.
These surmises had the desired effect
of break.ng the reserve of the gentlemen t .lay,

and extended to the streets Del Arsenal and
San Martin where the police force succeeded in
restoring order. All the North Americans ex
cept two state that tho police did their duty,and
from the voluminous proceedings it app.-ars
that the court has done its duty.
Whenever the prosecuting attorney renders an
opinion and the time for producing evidence

The minister, when asked by an Associ
ated Press reporter for an opinion, called
special attention to the statement that all
the North Americans excepting two had
said the police did their duty. He retards
this as favorable to the Chilean
side of the controversy. It is
noted that the Chilean minister of
foreign affairs promises, when due process
ot law. according to Chilean jurispru
dence, shall be observed, that those found
guilty will be punished, and says these
judicial proceedings are being car
ried forward actively. This, in connec
tion with the statement that the
police did their duty, is significant
as showing that the Chilean government
docs not wish that the action of individ
uals belonging in Chile shall he confounded
with the actions of those connected with
the government and having official sta
tion. These lawless actions on the part of
individuals, as the dispatch says, are being
inquired into under the usual judicial pro
ceedings of Chile, which are conducted
secretly, and, it is said, with the cumber
someness attaching to nearly ail law courts
deriving their authority and precedents
from Spain. This government has never
asserted the right to interfere with the
ordinary judicial methods of other na
tions. It is, however, watchful
to see that the customary judiciary meth
ods are followed, regarding, of course, the
extraordinary character of the offense,
and in the meantime making provision for
the always possible occurrence of some
untoward event, such as undue delay or a
linal response not consistent with the
dignity of the United States.
Within the last few days instructions
have been sent to our naval attaches at
Lomlon. Paris and Rome to acquaint the
state department with the movements of
Chile's agents in Great Britain and on the
continent. Similar instructions hare
been sent to tne United States consuls at
u number of the more important mari
time cities of Europe. It is known that
Chile has been quietly negotiating with
some big gun manufacturers for the
purchase ot heavy ordnance and other
munitions of war. It is algo known that
several of the brightest young men in the
Chilean army have been sent to Germany
to study the latest modes of war.
It is now expected that in the event of
hostilities the representatives at Santiago
of Russia and France will join in a re
quest to President Montt that the nine
Chilean retapf-s at present under the pro
tection of Minister Eean be permitted
to accompany him out of the country. It
is also expected that the representative of
Great Britain wiil join in this request. If
so. it is hard to see how the Chilean
authorities can refuse it.

had heard nothing except Irom tne newspapers
about the assassination of General Garcia and
the desertion of his troops to the revolutionists.

probable.

army are nearly all convicted criminals,
who, instead of lieing given terms in
prison, were sentenced to serve their
term with the military. They are desperate
CliHracters, nnd nearly all secret sympathizers
with revolutionary movements. General Garcia
is one of the most prominent and efficient offi
cers in the Mexican army, and his death at the
present time is a serious blow to the gov
ernment. Governor Keis has teen in constant
telegraphic communication with President
Diaz all day, but the nature of the dispatches is
not knowu. Governor Keis, of the state of
Nuevo Leon, and the military authorities here
are much disturbed over the situation on the
frontier. The movement of troops through

Mexican railroad have not been sufficient to
accommodate the hear? dem-tnd made upou
