BIRTHS AND DEATHS.
More Came Into the World Than
Left It in 1891.
VERY LOW RATE OF MORTALITY.
Vital Statistics of • Tear Railroad
Building in Twelva Mont ha
Notes of the Past Year.
Vital statistics compiled from the monthly
Imports of the health office ,how the fact that
IB' Seattle during the past year there were
bat 572 deaths, which, figuring upon
a population of 50,000 (including the
annexed district) would give a death rate of
11.44 per thousand. As the number of deaths
Include many in the hospitals from
accidents to persons in the mines, saw-
Bills and lodging camps in all parta
of the Puget sound basin, the normal death rate
of Seattle may be safely put down as low aa nine
to the thousand, which Is lower than that of
any other largo city in the United State, last
year. It i» a l * o interesting to note that there
were more births than deaths. The figures are
jivsa below:

In commenting on the work of the office,
Register T. M. Reed said: "The business is not
half of what it was last year. In no place :s
the effect of the hard times felt more qufkly
th/ia in the laud office. When money is tight
lend vulues ste naturally depressed, and there
•« less inducement to take up claims.
•'Another point to be remembered is that
•uchoi the best land is already takea, and
•hough there are still fine claims they are not so
•ccesv.ble and people are not so eager for them.
"Tlio inducements to tako land for epecuta-
M»# purposes are not so strong as heretofore,
last year a man could live on a claim for six
•souths and at a small expense procure a claim
•orth fcyo or fuA>. Now a residence of fourteen
teoaths on a claim is needed from ths day of
•otry, sa l more ample proofs are required be
fore a patent is issued.
"Whiie it is more difficult to get hold of land
Speculation or for sa e to corporations, still
toe laws ss amended during the la*t year will
do aw:ty with many contests and the clouding
of titles."

than one-half of the total for 1891. At that
time, however, there were only city, road, tire,
gas, water and cemetery funds. It will be a
week yet before matters are in 6uch shape that
the comptroller can make a full report.
MINISTER IN JOY AND SORROW,
Couples Made Happy and Grief Light-
ened by Rev. John F. Damon.
Rev. John F. Damon has found the year 1891
as busy a one as any that have gone before ia
his long residence in Seattle. During that year
he joined together 113 couples in the bonds of
wedlock as firmly as a good man's blessing
could join them. He stood by 101 open graves
and poured bulm on the souls of the bereaved
by his word, of Christian consolation. By the
sacrament of baptism he ushered tea porsoas
into the fold of the church.
Mr. Damon can justly boast that he has mar
ried more couples than any other clergyman in
Seattle, and they are all well married, too.
When a bereaved family has to lay awiy the re
mains of a loved one they usually call on him
to lighten the burden of their grief. When
these duties do not occupy his mind ho devotes
it to quiet acts of charity among tho sick and
poor. Thousands will join in wishing him a
happy New Year.
Mayor Hail's Annual Report.
Mayor llall iutends to prepare a careful an
nual report, but can do little on it un>
til the reports of ail the other city offi
cials are completed and submitted to
him. The charter does not specifically
require annual reports from the various city
officials, but in suction 36 of article IV. it re
quires tho city council to make a fail and com
plete re[>ort in pamphlet form of all matter,
appertaining to city affairs, and to give one to
every citizen over the age of 21 who shall ask
for the same.
Note, About the Old Year.
During the year 1891 there were fiied in the
county clerk's office 2,497 new suits, an average
of a little over 200 a month. During the tamo
time there were 1,388 judgments rendered in ail
departments of the superior court. The total
number of suits filed in King county since tho
establishment of the superior court is 12,412.
The new city council went Into office October
14,1890, and up to yesterday had passed 411 gen
eral and special ordinances, 130 resolutions, and
nineteen charter amendments have been con
sidered.
During 1891 th® county auditor issued 894
licenses to wed. In the same time 20,200 instru
ments of various kinds were filed In the Earns
office. Both of those figures comp.tre favorably
w.th the preceding year.
The total number of patienta received at Grace
hospital duriiiK 1891 was S*9. Following ia the
number received euch month: January, 32;
February, 20; March, 88; April, 26; May, 22;

A BATON FOR CHIEF ROGERS.
Bsndaoms Testimonial Presented by
tli# Police Force.
Last evening shortly after Chief of Police Bol»
ton Rogers returned from his home, a number
of police officers, with Lieuteuaat Sims at their
head, presented the chief with an elegant gold
mounted ebony baton. The incident of presen
tation was marked by so united an expression
of good will that the occasion will always be
pleasantly remembered by all who had a share
therein.
The night sqnad was called out into the main
room of headquarters, forming a circle. Lieu
teuaat Sims stood near the door with the batoa
under his coat. Chief Rogers was about to step
out for a moment, when his progress was barred
by the cordon of men. Before the chief could
suspect the design upoa him Lieutenant Sims
advanced a few paces, aad drawing the baton,
■aid:
Chief Rogers, the pleasant duty has beea as
signed to rne of presenting to you, from your
frien is, thi, baton. It is <le*igned as.nn emblem
o: tho important office which you occupy and
H is a token of the esteem ia which the mem
bers of this department hold you. Since assum
ing the leadership of this department you have
conducted it upon R fair and honorable basis,
and the men appreciate ttiis. and wsth this gift
go the best wishes of every officer and man
who serves uuder you. In after years we hops
that those who bear your name will regard tbia
us an heirloom to be proud of, and an evidence
of the honor and integrity with which your
office hus been administered. Under your
management the men of the police force of Se
attle have not only touched elbows but hearts aa
well.
Tho men vigorously applauded the neat ex
pression of good will, and the opportunity was
thereby given Chief Rogers to recover some
what from his undoubted surprise. In response
he said:
Gentleman, I am not much of a talker, and iD
view of this op>en expres-ion of youresteem, I
could have wished for time sufticieut to have
made a suitable resDonse. When I assumed the
chieftainship of this department I promised to
conduct it without fear or favor upon a strict
business basis. At times I have beeu confronted
with hindrances from the outside, but the men
of the force have been loyal and faithful
in every particular and have in every way
aided me in mauing of this department an im
portant factor in maintaining the peace and
good order of the city. If I have appeared strict
and severe at times it has been with the sole
aim of increasing the efficiency of the force, and
not with a desire of wounding the feeliugs of
the individual. Gentlemen. I thank vou for
this gilt I shall always prize it highly, and I
can only hope that our relations in the future
will be ns they have beea ia the past, of the
most cordial nature.
The baton is a very handsome one. It is made
of solid ebony, and is mounted at both ends
with solid gold. It bears the Inscription: "Pre
sented to Boltoa Rogers by hi, friends, Jaauary
1, 1892."
EATON WANTED TO OO HOME.
Letter From Runions Tells of His Elope»
ment and Pretended Repeatance.
Further particulars of the matrimonial en«
tanglemente of Arthur B. Eaton were learned
yesterday through a letter from A. J. Runions
of Canton, N. Y., dated December 23, and re
ceived by a gentleman in this city. Runions ia
the friend of the family whose inquiries about
Eaton first put the police on his track.
Mr. Runions encloses a photograph of Carrie
Blodgett, who eloped with Eaton from Hamil
ton, Oswego county, N. Y., to Titusville, Ps.,
and who is the same as Mrs. Eaton No. 2. His
wife tracked tho couple there and had them
arrested, but Eaton secured his release by
promises of fidelity, and appears then to have
come West with Mrs. Eaton No. 2.
He says that Mrs. Eaton No. 1 has received a
letter from her husband asking her to ssnd him
f73 60 that he can return to her, telling of his
vain attempts to obtain employment and pro
testing his iove for her. But Mr. Runions ad
vised Mrs. Eaton not to send the money until
she had looked Into the matter. Ho says that
Mrs. Eaton is to be in Canton at noon on the
day he writes. He expresses a wish to have
Eatoa back home to live with his wife again,
and suggests that Inquiries be made to find out
Eaton's intentions before his first wife sends
him any money.
The fact that Eaton aad wife Not 2 were ar
rested at Titusville seems to ,how that the
latter must have known that the man she had
eloped with was already married.
A REPUBLICAN CLUB.
Plana for a Strong Organization—Con
venient Meeting Rooms.
A movement is on foot for the organization of
a strong Republican club; and the membership
roll has already been sigued by many of the
leading members of the party ia this city.
Though the organization has not yet been per
fected, those interested in the plan have se
cured for headquarters two large, well-lighted
rooms in the southwest corner of the Butler
block. These rooms, which will be comfortably
furnished and provided with copies of all the
leading political papers, will be kept open day
and evening. Until after the presidential eleo
tion they will serve as a rendezvous for the Re
publlraus resident in Seatllo and thos, visiting
the city.

The Proorress of the Century
Leans away from superstition and blind
idolatry of isms an i ics—allopathic in
cluded. It leans toward universal, all
determining law; towards facts. Dot fan
cies. It leans towards immutable princi
ples and invulnerable truth, and away
from superannuated authority, organized
ignorance and dyed-in-the-wool prejudice.
Band empiricism in medicine has, with
other fossilized bivalves had its day. Yes,
there are plenty of "be ated crabs." but
being born of darkness and fear—twin sis
ters of intellectual infar.cv—they cannot
much longer withstand the Civilizing in
fluence of advancing science. They are
slowly but surely "dying Esrypt, dying"
before the light" of investigation.
The advancing thinker winders how it
was possible for that monstrosity—the
medical science (?) extan: now, to* have
survived to this late day! But where was
the reform to come lrom? It iV not only
Sasse to attempt reform, it is outright
angerous. It requires a boldness akin to
recklessness. Legion is the nama who
have tried; they have left their bleaching
bones as a warning. An attempt at re
forming theology brands you a "heretic;"
in politics you are charged with every in
famy under the sun and in medicine every
duck-intellect "quacks" at you and vrut
are accused of having no diploma when
your dioloma is on tile in the courthouse
under the very eyes of the slanderers. All
this is caused by besotted ignorance, and
since books are sent free of charge toevery
applicant and we pay the postasre. there is
no excuse for ignorance when it costs
nothing to be informed. People who be
rate the Histogenetic system of medicine
are either intellectual pariahs incapable of
counting Lve in successior or understand
ing any 'Jx4 problem, or they are mental
sluggards and cannot screw themselves up
to the point of information by reading up
and forming a conclusion. In either case
their opinio as areas valuable as that of
Puget sound oysters.

Dr. J. Eugene Jordan, Seattle, Wash.,
Dear Sir: Nearly four months have pass
ed since I wrote you. As I know you are
interested in my case I wish to teli you
how lam progressing. Before I com
menced taking your medicines I was suf
fering most excruciating pain. I had tried
every sort of remedy and gained abso
lutely no rel ef. Alter I had taken the
Histogenetic medicines a short time how
ever, the pain and swelling became less
until it was gone entirely. I cannot ex
press my gratitude as I have been sick for
years, treating with so many prominent
physicians and getting worse* all the time.
I bless the day that I lett San IFrancisco
for Washington as I know that had I not
come here and consulted you I would
have been in my grave. I wish that every
one might read this as I want them to
keow how much I have to l>e thankful
for. May you live many years to relieve
and bless your fellow creatures.
