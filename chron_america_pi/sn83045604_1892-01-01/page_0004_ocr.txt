THE Siff VEAK.
The New Year stands like the winred
Mercary ready poised for its first drsy of
f.ght. L.ke ail our famous Ciirifi.su bol

Year's day, as *e.i as Cbr-stmas, is
a day of gift-siring rather than of
feastinsr. The "L>; iens'' Christmas of
liberal feasting, br sdfunandn isy mer

of the day, as aeen in France an i

and more a day of charity and

In the same sp.nt New Year's is
treated; a day of gifi-giving and of kindly
salutation, when the sorrows of the oid
yejf trt sent, like Satan, to the rear, ar.d
a;: rune i. pe rather than brooding, pen
sive memory rules the hoar. Oar modern
holiday si:.l reflects something of the hirh
color with which it was imbued by our
Baxcn ancestors, though happily the ex
cessive conviviality that at no very remote
date mi-spa its oe.ebratioa is fast j«».2g
away, even in our ?r< at cities, where it
was once the perilous fashion of the time.
The Dutch founders of Manhattan made
much of the festival of the New Year, and
it has natura iy coaae to he the important
holiday of New York, Philadelphia, Balti
more and Washington. The custom of
New Year"? calls, once universally ob
served in the Last, has fallen into disre
pute with jeople of refinement, because
the boepitaiity that was intended for and
belonged only to friends and neighbor*,
was abused by persons who claimed and
asserted a right on New Year's day they
d 1 not claim and assert on any other day
of the year. There was a good deal'.f
tippling from house to house, and so the
generous hospitality to which frienis
were gladly welcomed was gradually aban
doned when it became converted into a
public and indiscriminate entertainment
of a crowd of boozy callers, who ate and
drank themselves into a state of stupidity
by nightfall and thought they were very
fanny when they were only very fulL
Whea hospitality is a v uaed it is time to
shut the door, an! New Year's day is dead
in many place® at the East as a matter of
general olrservance because its sober friends
w-re outnumbered by its drunken cele
brants. It is natural to moralize on New
Year's day abut the flight of time and pa
thetically remind each other that to the
churchyard we are creeping year by year,
but there is a better ph:i tsoj hy than this
of longing for length of days and bewail
ing the Jlight of time. The philosophy
need not te the epicurean i lea of a short
life aiid a merry one. but let it be a useful,
vigorous li.'e, full of m ral purpose and
B-anly effort, whether it be long or short.
New Year's to fh( b -y is a jOfOM sea
son, because aglow with abounding health
Le longs for manhood and what he fondly
thinks is the desirable felicity of its en
larged personal freedom and social privi
leges, while New Year's makes the old
man, if he has le i * k.n ily. decent life,
recall * ta tend-: r melancholy the sweet
visions of his z* :ic tut and j-.yous child

But if the old raan b-vs lei a ?nean, low,

him only a t.rue to mutter curves over the
early decay and tieaih of noole powers of

11I15CIPATIO!! P\T.
The greatest New Year's day of modem
times was that of January 1. l?o3,
all the bells ia the rocking steeples of the
North rang out freedom to toe s are, fsr
then it was that Lincoln made lit-erty a
New Year's gift to every negro that "as in
l oads. That was a great dsy for thena
tlon when a stolen birthright was made a
New Year's gift to ade«f.ised rare and the
anniversary of emancipation w;l 1 there
fore be today in the caps of cur colored
p pa:at:on freshly remembered, whererer
they can meet for thst purpose with no
one to molest them or make them afraid.
When Lincoln elected president he
wis ia no sense a radical anti-slarery
man. In his great debate with Doaglas in
J ; " Lh-aln sustained the fug tire s'.are
law as something tbe Sou'h had a right to
demand under the const.tution and the
North had no right to refuse: be declared
he was r.ot in faror of the abolition of
- aTtry in the District cf Columbia excep»t
the majority of its people wanted it, and
eren t:.en would not for it exoept
under gradual emancipation, associated
w.th compensation to masters; he would
have Toted f.-r the admission of a sta-e
w.th a constitution permitting slarery,
provided the right of congress to exclude
slavery from its soil while a territory had
beea enforced.
In one of his rpeeches in ISSB Lincoln
said that if he believed the right to hold a
•Inve in a terr.tory as as constitutional
as the right to reclaim a fugitive negro he
woaid feel bound to support it. Lincoln
even confessed he was for a white man's
government, bat held that s.avery was an
evii to he tolerated in the states, to be ex
cluled from the territories, wh»re neither
congress, the territorial legislature, nor
the supreme court could rightfully author
ize it before it became a state. Jeff Davis
he; i that the constitution carried slavery
everywhere, whether in state 01 territories,
and that neither congress cor territorial
legislature could rightfully exclude it.
Douglas held that s.avery, right or
wrong, had a right to existence in eny
territory where the majority of the people
wantei it, and denied the right of any
interference cf congress with their will,
•u v ;ect to the federal constitution and the
supreme court. The truth is that Lincoln,
before the war, was only a Henry Clay
Whig; that is, while as a philanthropist
he deplored the existence cf s.avery as a
terrible social evil. nevertheless, as a poli
tician, he granted the ngtuth all the p-o
--tection c.ear.y pledge i to it by the consti
tution. He would not warp or wrench the
constitution to extend s.avery nor to pro
hibit it; he would give the South its clear
constitutional rights, and he would insist
on the exclusion of slavery from new terri
tories, because he believed that congress
was clearly authorized under the constitu
tion to do th.s w.ih jut violating the con
stitutional rights of the slaveholders.
Lincoln was not 3 Republican in the
that S* ward. Cha;e. humner and
Greeley were Republicans; he was a Henry
Clay Whir, who handled s.avery during
the war as tentatively as Clay could have
done. Patrick Henry and John Quincy
Aiamshai long ago proclaimed emanci
pation as among the clear war powers of
the constitution which the president could
invoke, but believing that it could not be
ecmstitnti lulljmyiojtd except as an it
dispensable military necessity, Lincoln
disapproved and repudiated the action of
General Fremont in August, l ir l, and of
General Hunter as late as May, l*y2, wl.en
they as umel under their local military
powers to proclaim emancipation.
McClellan, in May, 1 "•> 1, proclaimed in
West Virginia no interference with
t.'ie slaves. and promised to sup
ines* a serv.'» insurrecti a. In June. IsCI,
the Federal General Fatterson eagerly of
fer-! to suppress a serv; e insurrection if it
eh -u'd occur in a «tate already in rebellion.
General Mansueld refu* 1 t:> almit the
fugitive slaves of ret-els to Lis camps, and
General Hooker, in Ma- ~ 1-c-J. hunted
them out and returned them to rebel
masters. Halle k ei:« lle-i them; Dix re
pulse! them in face of the act of congress
of Ju'y 2!, 1" 1. e:ua .cipat<ng slaves that
ha! been usei to al l rebellion. General
Williams, at Baton Rouse, refused fuci
tiv»« f rebel a::i«ters. an i McClellan, July
7,1562, wrote Lincoln a letter strongly
protesting again?: emancipation as a war
measure.
As late as the 22d of August. 1562, Lin
coin wrote Greeley that ha would save the
Union without freeing a slave if he could
save it quickest that way. or he would free
all the slaves to save it if he c aid save it
best that w.sv. His primary purpose was
to save the Union, and r. >t to save o- de
stroy slavery. Personally he wished all
men everywhere might be free, but as
r res lent he only toe.hei slavery to he.p
the Union, or forbore when to touch it
hurt the Union. Finally, thirty days
art?r th» Greeley letter and live lays after
t'r > 1 a't'e of An::etam, on September 22.
: e emancipation pro '.sr..at >n was
issued as a wax measure, and Lincoln to
the last a'.wsvs «a:d that his proolamat -n
w i n ; intended as an act of moral jus
tice. but as the invocation of the war
p we: against the resources of rebellion.
To Secretary Cha*e Lincoln wrote:

Lincoln always rested the authority cr*
his great proclamation on his war
powers ani its justification upon
mi-tary necessity. He declared that
h.s oath of ot&ee forbade him to in
dulge h.s primary abstract judgment on
the moral question of slavery. If he
could have saved the Union by saving
slavery Lincoln Lave done it. nn

A NEW TEAK'S CALL
f\ V
A A A A klj wJTJ IXI
\ \
TF there is anything that makes us smile a long, broad and
J- supremely happy smile, it is to sell somebody a spanking
suit of clothes and have his best girl spoil its elegance by spill- \
ing wine and jelly cake all over it when he calls on her on New
\ Year's Day. It may make him feel a little blue at first, but the \
\ month ot January is generally quite busy with us in supplying
the Gents of our city with AX EXTRA suit for the coming spring* . j
Overcoats are also in high demand and a finer stock than ours
is hard to find. ou see we are always prepared to meet all
cemands and do not lear that we cannot supply yours,
* Give Us a Xew Year's Call
And even though you come a day or two late, we readik* excuse *
\ i "
ail ce.ays of that kind, but do not put it off too long, as we are
\ now prepared to treat you most hospitably. \
