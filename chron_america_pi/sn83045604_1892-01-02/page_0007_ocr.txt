Waownce and dyed-in-the-wc ol prejudice.
A 1 empiricism in medicine has, with
other fossilized bivalves had its day. Yes,
there are plenty of "belated crabs." but
being born of darkne-s and fear—twin sis
ters of intellectual infancy—they cannot
much longer withstand th» civilizing in

slowly but surely "dying E_»vpt,
before the ".earch light" of investigation,
the advancing thinker wonders how it
was possible for that monstrosity—the
medical science (?) extani now. to have
survived to this iate day! But where was
the reform to come from? It is not ouiv
p.*s«e to attempt reform, it is outriglit
dangerous. It requires a boldness akin to
recklessness. Leg-on is the name who
nave tried; they bavo left their bleaching
bones as a warning. An attempt at re
forming theology brands you a '"heretic;"
in politics you are charged with every in
tarnv und'»r the sun and in medicine every
duck-intellect "quacks" at you and vou
are accused of having no diploma when
your diploma is on tile in the courthouse
under the very eyes of the slanderers. Ail
this is caused by besotted ignorance, and
since books are sent free of charge toevery
appiicant and we pay the postage, there is
no excuse for ignorance when it costs
nothing to be informed. People who be

are either intellectual pariahs incapable of
counting live in successior or understand
ing any 2x4 problem, or they are mental
sluggards and cannot screw themselves up
to the point of information by reading up
and forming a conclusion. In either case
their opinions are as valuable as that of
Puget sound oysters.

I'ear Sir: Nearly four months hare pass

interested in my case I wish to tell you
how lam progressing. Before I com
menced taking your medicines I was suf
fering most excruciating pain. I had tried
every sort of remedy and gained abso
lutely no relief. After I had taken the
Histogenetiq medicines a short time how
ever, the pain and swelling became less
until it was gone entirely. I cannot ex
press my gratitude as I have been sick for
years, treating with so many prominent
physicians and getting worse all the time.
I bless the day that I left San IFrancisco
for Washington as I know that had I not
come here and consulted you 1 would
have been in my grave. I wish that every
one might read this as I want them to
keow how much I have to be thankful

HALF FORMED COAL
A Vein of It Underlying the
Hills of Seattle.
VEGETATION OF A PAST ERA.
Outcropping* of the Streak Where Soli
la Worn Away —Grain of
the Wood.
Few people are aware that a vein of half
formed coal underlies the hills on which
Seattle is built. This streak of vegetable
matter lies in the clay usually thirty or
forty feet below the surface, but in places
where the soil ha? been worn away it crops
out. and workmen who are grading now
and then strike into it.
When the cut was made in Cherry street
between Fifth and Sixth, the layer was
fotind not more than six or seven feet
down. In the deep cat in front of the
Denny hotel the streak from one to three
feet in thickness ran at a level about
twenty feet down. Not long ago the
graders on Eleventh steeet found a huge
boulder which they got rid of by digging a
deep pit into which they rolled it. In their
excavation, however, they went down
through this layer of peat, or whatever it
may be called.
This stuff is soft, and cats as easily as
clay. While in some places it has become
quite Mack and hard, in others it is soft
like rotten wood. The layer is a dense one,
with very littie dirt in it. It i 3 evident
that the vegetation of which it is formed
was like that of today, for in some places
the wood is so well preserved that the dif
ference between fir and cedar can bo de
tected by the practiced eye.
Since those trees grew the whole sur
face of the country has apparently been
plunged for years below the level of the
ocean, tor in the highest hills a compact
layer of gravel and clay, seventy or more
feet thick, completely covers the deposit
of wood and bark and leaves. The stuff
is saturated with moisture, but when dried
out it burns readily.

IMPROVEMENTS IN RAILROADING.
How Cost of Kails (fas Decreased tn
Twenty Years.
Mr. and Mrs. 11. W. Holler and Miss Mabel
Iloiley, of B[>oknne, sra at the Northern hotel.
Mr. Holler, who is an old resident of Minne
sota, is now looking over this state with a view
to settli: gia Washington. He came to Minne
sota ia 1555, while it wits yet a territory. In
those days ha took an active part In politics,
ar.d was a member cf the const:tutional con
vention and also of the first state legislature.
From 1-01 to IS6B he was register of the
Winnebago City land office. Aft r that he
took un active interest in railroad buiidiag and
railroading.
"I remember," said he last night, "when our
nearest railroad was at Dubuque, 400 miles away.
We came the rest of the way to ft. I'aul by boat.
Though the Mississippi is navigable to St Paul,
yet the railrua Is havj nearly kilted navigation
there. Ample proof hat luen givea t-iero of the
falsity of the old saviog that railroads can never
compete with boats in carrying freight. The
railroads take most of the fright, and the
steamers can beat them only when a whole
cargo of nai:s or sjrne such thing is brought all
the way by water from Pittsburg. Tho average
merchant, however, cannot ord»>r a cargo of nai •«,
and for small quantities railroad freirhts are
lower—ar.d then, too, transportation is q u ker.
"This decrease In charges has b?en brought
about, not as the grangers imagine, by their
ranting and their anti-monopoly laws, but by
the cheapening of trio cast of otierating road*.
"A ruilmsd does not co-t as much to build and
maintain as it use J to. In I-H and ISoi I was
interested in the construction of the southern
part cf the Milwaukee A «-t. Paul system. Onr
rail cost us tasn 10 a ton lai l down In New
York, and we had to pay HO more to get them on
the ground whero we wanted theia. Th 'S®
rails wereot iron, worth in use sty half as much
as tee steel rail of today. Yet we can buy that
rail for *35 a ton. So yon see that taking every
thing into account, rails cost only one-fourth of
what they once did.
"And every cut in the cost of rails has been
followed by an inevitable cut in freight and
passenger rates."
NEW TOUK TOLITICS.
What Democratic Control of the Legis-
lature Means.
No one in Seattle follows the course of New
York polities more clo«ely than Louis K. Church,
a Democrat, and Fremont Cole, a Republican.
Both were formerly members of the New York
leg slature, sad Mr. Co'.* held the b'gh cJR"e of
speaker. When Presidaat Cleveland came in
he appointed Mr. Church joveraor of I»»koU,
and Mr. Church—as is natural—has never beea
a:i enthusiastic admirer of Governor llill.
In speaking of the decision of the court cf ap
pes » by which the Democrats rapture the legis
lature, Mr. Cole sa>d yesterisy: "Thst means
that you and I probably will not live to see
aavther Republican United States aenatur
chosen from the stale oi New York. The Demo
crat*, now that they hare coatiol of tLo legis
lature. will redistrietit soas to gain sereral con-
and betw-en twenty and twenty-flvs
n.embers oi the legislature. They will probsfcly
get a round doten m N-w York city alone, and
fve or six more in Brooklyn. Since the legisla
ture has been closs lor several years,
even according to the Republican districting
ci lite state, 1 sse not tne Slightest ciisate !->:
Kepubliran Ascendancy again for some years to
come. The Democrats will probably bare full
twiner w!;ea the tlmt comei toeltct t iucnuoi
t senator Frans Ihscock."
Ex-Uovernor Church st;d: "To my mind the
Democratic control o! the lee:«lati:re
that New York ia no longer in the doubtful
column, but i« safely Democratfc in is J. ( T or<
ernor David B. Hill has {ought the good fight
and kept the faith ia bringing at-out th.s good
result —and though of course I love Ororsf
Cleveland ss a broker, I love Hill *3 a brother,
too."
NORTH SEATTLE SEWER Tl NNKL,
Excavating Abont Half Done—To An
swer for Twenty-Ore Year*.
The city engineer's department is making
steady progress en the North Seattle sower tun
nel. The who'.e length of this underground
passage is s.feet. and of this 2,7fc> feet has
be' n excavated. As fast as the workmen dig the
tunnel is timbered up. The hole in the ground
is Sxs feet, whi.e the sise oi the tunnel will be
6xo. The formations of earth struck as the men
advance are hardpan, quicksand aad clay. The
deepest part beneath the earth's surface Is ltd
feet and the shallowest is sixty feet.
The tunnel commences near Lake Union at
Roliin and Republican streets and will end at
the foot of Depot street, draining the entire
Lake Union basin. The intention is to conduct
the refuse far out into the bay by an iron pipe
connected with the mouth of the sewer, while
the water wi.l rush through Jthe reeu'.ar large
sewer gate. The sewer, It is estimated, will an.
swer all the necessities of the district for fuhy
twenty-five yer.rs.
It is undersu>od that In his annual report to
the board of publio works City Engineer Albro
Gardner will urge the necessity of a similar sew
erage system for the southern part of the city.
