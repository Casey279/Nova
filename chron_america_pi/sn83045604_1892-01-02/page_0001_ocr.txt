SEATTLE. WASHINGTON, SATURDAY. JANUARY 2. 1892
FORAKER ASD SHERMAN
The Lively Tnar-of-War for the
Ohio Senatorship.
EX-GOVERNOR SEEMS TO LEAD
He Attackg Baby McKee, President
and Federal Oftice-Holders.
Ex-Congressman Terklni Appointed
Senator From Kansas, to Succeed
I'luinb—Senator Stewart Writes to
Uill Abont Consistency on Silver.
CoLCMBrs, 0., Jan. I.—Upon the waver
ing uncertainty of less than a dozen votes
depends the solution of the Ohio sena
torial contest. The battle which began
immediately after the November election
has been unremittingly waged ever since
by the followers of Senator Sherman and
ex-Governor Foraker. until the opening of
the year linds the lines so tightly drawn
that nine-tenths of the Republican legis
lators liave been compelled to openly de
clare preferences. There will be ninety
three Republicans in the senatorial
caucus, and Sherman and Foraker each
have forty-two or forty-three votes defin
itely pledged. Of the eight or nine non
committal each side makes positive claims
on secret pledges of fully two-thirds of
them, but the gentlemen themselves reiuse
to talk. The candidates both seem unus
ually confident this evening, but neither
will submit to an interview.
The Farmers' Alliance has not proven a
potent political factor in Ohio, but strenu
ous attempts will be exerted to secure the
influence of the organization against the
re-election of Sherman. J. 11. M:t"h
ell, chairman of the legislative com
mittee of the Franklin county
Alliance, states this evening that he is
here to oppose Senator Sherman. Senator
Sherman said: "I expect the state com
mittee of the Alliance to be on hand
Monday to exert their influence in the
same direction." Senator Sherman's
friends assert that the Farmers' Alliance
organization is taking no formal action in
the contest.
Representative Welsh, of Knox county,
maintains his peculiar position in the
content, and he is hilariously endeavor
ing to create a McKinley boom, greatly to
the embarrassment of the govern jr-eiect.
lie has announced positively that he will
never support Sherman, and asserts that
the proper solution of the question is the
election of McKinley. The Foraker peo
ple expect to receive his support on the
second ballot, should the contest be pro
longed to the second ballot. The sena
torial caucus will be held Wednesday
night, but there is no doubt the contest
will he pr.icurally settled before that, and
that the caucuses will l>e a mere formality.
It is generally conceded that J. F. Neal.
of Butler county, chairman of the Demo
cratic state committee, will receive the
Democratic caucus nomination.
The senatorial contest unexpectedly took
a sensational turn late tonight when ex-
Governor Foraker made a speech criticis
ing the interference of the national ad
ministration and declaring for James G.
Blaine for the presidency. A delegation
of several hundred admirers called upon
him, asking for a speech. Foraker grace
fully responded to the invitation. After a
few laughing remarks upon general topics,
Foraker said:
Somebody said about three month* ago that
he would not scramble for re-election. It is my
impression that he has changed his mind. At
least that is indicated by the presence in Colum
bus tonight not only oi al! the representatives
by appointment that hold office within the bor
ders of our state, but uli who can be commanded
from ail the confines of the United States. We
have iu this tight to contend upon our side
against everything, from grandfather's hat to
Baby MfKee, but we sbal! win the fi-ht.
After repeatad statements that he would
win, the speaker referred to Sherman, pay
ing him many compliments, saying he
had made a good senator, and adding:
1 have no ill wilt toward any Republican lie
cau*e ha favors Sherman instead of myself. I
have been favoring wherman for the !a»t thirty
years. Twice with words of earnest commenda
tion I have nominated him for the presidency.
1 never uttered one word I did uot believe,
and not one word would I retract now.
He has been and is « great
man. His record is illnstrlnim. He is all that
is implied by the word ••grand." But if the
Republicans of Ohiosh iuld happen to take a
notion that he has been there lon* enough f am
not going to stand iu the way if they so desire,
j Nor do 1 think the result will l>e accepted more
; grH< i"iisly by any one than by .senator Sherman
! himself. But should they decide to send
| him back I shall accommodate myself
| to the situation. No man is a better
Republican i nn myself, and in the next
battle you will find m.-, as heretofore, shoulder
to shoulder for the standard bearer, whosoever
he tuny be. helping all I can in the presentation
; of our prim ip es and doing a'.l in my power to
j win t iccess for our great jw*rtv and foi the good
| and glory of the United States. [Tremendous
; applause.}
I do not know the nest standard-bearer
may be. Our present president has given us a
jjood administration, hut if the people should
t.':ke a notion that James G HI sine should
n ni: ■ ated ['ipplnu-e, great and prolonged; we
w jl. try to aeetpt that, too, and if he should be
nam. 1 we w;.l triumphantly ele<t him [re
newed ;trplauM-]. and when he '•hall have been
e eeted, we i>hsll have in the Wh.te House the
greatest o! all living Americans. ( tremendous
I cheering.
There was great excitement tonight
when Representative D't, of Cincinnati,
pers-r":illy called at Snermsn headquar
ter* and pledged his support to Senator
Mierman. Mr. l)ix's action is regarded as
slunilicant, as the Hamilton county dele
gation had been heretofore soiid for
Foraker.
There was great excitement in the For
aker camp at 1 o'clock this (Saturday)
morning, when an extended interview
was given, pledging Representatives
Reeves, of Ashta'mla. and Williams, of
Not > county, to the support of Foraker.
F> r ;tker's friends claim this insures his
nomination.

STEWART TO SENATOR HILL.
Nevada Mine Owner Accuses Tammany
Politician of Silver Inconsistency.
ASHINGTO!* CITY. Jan. I.—Senator
Stewart, of Nevada, has written a letter to
Senator David B. Iliil, in reply to the
speech inade by the latter yesterday, in
Albany, and of that passage of the speech
assuring Bland of the respect, admiration
atid support of the Democracy of New
York, it he will move the repeal of the
present law. The letter says:
■\ou are aware, Mr. Hill, that this is an old
story; that the people of the South and West
have been assured ever siuce silver was rejected
a* money of the respect and admiration of the
New \ork Democracy, if they would co-operate
with the rjpreseiitatives of the gold trust in
contracting the reai money of the world to gold
alone. In a recent speech at Eimira you advo
cated free bi-mataltic coinage. In your Albany
speech, on New Year's eve, you advocated tho
repeal of the act of 1890, which gives
the people more money, by the difference be
tween the silver certificates issued on coin of
J-M.OOOJ'IOO worth of silver per annum and the
amount of tieasury notes issued iu the purchase
of 54.000,000 ounces of silver bullion each year.
The silver act must inevitably lead to bi-meti.l
- coinage to prevent depreciation of silver, and
I assert that it is because of the recognition of
this iact that the gold men desire to pre
vent the psssage of a free coinage act, and pro
pose a repeal of the law of IVKJ.
I am sorry, if you are really in favor of free
bi-metallic coui'tge aa declared in your Eimira
speech, thnt you have fallen into the trap aet by
the cold trust, and are now willing to aid them
in thvir eflorts to confine the real money of the
world to gold alone.
Governor Flower's Inauguration.
ALBANY, N. Y„ Jan. I.—Roswell P.
Flower was inaugurated governor today.
Inaugural ceremonies were held in the
assembly chamber, which was gorgeously
decorated with American flags, bunting
and potted plants. The chamber and gal
leries were tilled to over/lowing long be
fore the inaugural party arrived. Shortly
before noon the new governor was escorted
to the capitol by soldiers. Following the
escort were the civic societies of this and
other cities. Flower and his honorary es
cort rode in open barouches. The streets
along the line of march were crowded.
The military display, in accordance
with Flower's expressed wishes, was
simple. Arriving at the capitol, Flower
and his staff were met by Governor Hill and
staff, and the party proceeded to the assem
bly chamber, where they were enthusi
astically received. The assemblage was
called to order by Mayor Manning. At
the conclusion of prayer. Governor Hill,
in a brief speech, transferred the duties of
his otlice to Flower. Flower responded in
a brief and appropriate speech, in which
he made no promises, but asked that he he
judged by his deeds rather than by his
words. Secretary of State liice then
stepped forward and administered the oath
of office to Governor Flower and Lieuten
ant-Governor Sheehan. The ceremonies
were brought to a close by Bishop l)oane
pronouncing the benediction. The inaug
ural party then returned to the executive
chamber, where a public reception was
held for over an hour.

PEACE, BITWITIIUONOR
Xew Chilean Cabinet Wants to
Settle Baltimore Affair.
GOOD ADVICE BY ENGLAND.
Insolent Note ofMiuister Matta Likely
to Be Recalled.
Minister Egan Kecelvea Assnrance of
tlie Desire of New Government to
Maintain Friendly Relations—Charle-
•ton and San Francisco at San Diego.
Santiago, j an> j—["New York Herald
Special.' —The new cabinet is generally
approved by the press and people of tha
country. Some reluctance was felt by
some ">i the members of the cabinet in tak
ing office because the exact situation of
affairs between the United States and
Chile was not known. There seems to be
a disposition to come to terms with the
I nited States, provided an amicable
arrangement can be made which
will not humilate Chile. I am
informed that there is a likelihood
that the note of the late minister of foreign
affairs, Senor Matta, which c.iu&ed such
oflense to the government at Washington
City, may be withdrawn. It is stated that
President Montt has been advised to with
draw Matta'B note, and a member of the
new cabinet said that the cabinet would
take up the question as soon as the report
of the court on the Baltimore affair is
made. No apprehension of a rupture is
felt, he said, despite the state of public
feeling on the subject.
Acting, presumably, under instructions
from his government. Kennedy, the Brit
ish minister, has been advising President
Montt's government to make reasonable
terms with the United States. Gutschtnidt,
the German minister, has offered the serv
ices of ins government as arbitrator be
tween the two countries, but in view of
the continued insults to our legation, both
covert and openly displayed, it is hardly
thought possible that a proposition to sub
mit the troubles to arbitration will be en
tertained.
Minister Egan today received a polite
note from Minister of Foreign Affairs
I'ereirta, informing him of the desire of
the new government to maintain friendly
relations with him both personally and of
licially, and also to preserve and maintain
the friendship existing between the coun
tries.
The mail orderly of the United States
cruiser Yorktown came ashore on Decem
ber 29 to pay for a cablegram and has not
been heard from since that time. The
police are looking for him.
SAX DIEGO, Cat., Jan. I.—The cruisers
San Francisco and Charleston are lying
near each other in the harbor. Captain
Itemy has very little to say, and Admiral
Brown says he has told all he can until
after congress reassembles. Captain Remy
says that since leaving here in July the
Charleston has been in Japan, China and
Honolulu, and on the return to this coun
try encountered terrible high sea 3, which
the cruiser stood splendidly, proving
her sea-going qualities to be the
very best. "We know absolutely
nothing about the Ch'lean situation,"
he said. "We were directed to come to
San Diego when we lt-lt Honolulu to meet
the San Francisco and take coal and am
munition. On Monday we will take coal
and receive ammunition and await further
orders." Captain Remy declined to say
whether he thought there would be war
with Chile of not, but it is evident that
he regards the situation as serious. Fur
ther than the foregoing, no information
can t>e elicited. It is evident, in the opin
ion of several officers of both vessels, that
the government is taking precautionary
measures and that San Diego is to be con
sidered a base of supplies. The cruiser
Baltimore is expected Saturday or Sun
day.
S EW YORK, Jan. I.—Mail advices to the
Associated l'ress from Valparaiso, Chile,
under date of December 2, relate an inci
dent in connection with the refugees
question, showing with what zeal they are
watched. One of them, %vho had been liv
ing at the American legation lor several
months, left there quietly the last
week in November and went
to his home, which is only
two doors from the legation. Spies dis
covered this. While they made no im
mediate attempt to arrest him, they bio le
aded his house to prevent his escape. The
next day the man requested Minister Egau
to escort him back to the legation, but
Egan notified him that he had left the
asylum voluntarily and he was unahle to
escort him back. Thanksgiving (lay was
observed by the American sailors in
Valparaiso bay by a number of boat
rac» s. and a dinner givt-n aboard the Bal
timore to the competing crews of themen
of war. The Baltimore and three French
vessels were the oniv men-of-war in port
at the time, and invitations were not ex
tended to the Chilean ships to take
part in the contest. On invitation
of Captain Schley, the commanders
of the Cochrane and Esmeralda and sev
eral other Chilean naval officers went
aboard the Baltimore an I witnessed the
races. The Americans won three races
and the Frenchmen one. There were also
a number of games aboard the Baltimore,
and afterward about 5 American and
French sailors had a Thanksgiving din
ner in the mess-room.
American Sailor* Injured by
WASHINGTON < ITY, Jan. I. A private
letter from a naval officer on the I'nited
elites steamer Iroquois, now at Apia,
,>amoa, gives particulars of the attack on
a boat's crew of American sailors by na
tiv» *of Samoa. The writer states ttiat a
thirty of natives, headed oy a man named
S. unlan. attacked a r.artv of sailors from
the Iroquois, breakinsr an arm of one of
the sailors and injuring several others.
They subsequently attaok«-d the gig's crew,
which was on shore waiting f»r the cap
tain, an<i injured one of the men seriously.
It was an unprovoked a»-«auit, according
to th* writer, but he does not intimate
that any action t ward redress was tnk»-n
by the officers of the Iroquois. No ofhial
information on the subject has yet been
received.
Frightful Ua*j*K*# of Utir«n« in ftrazil.
I .ON DON, Jan. 1, —Ix>rd Salisbury re
ceived Unlay a special cable dispatch from
her maj <ty's consul at Santos, confirming
the recent alarming reports in regard to
' the terriolc state of affairs there, growing
out of the ravages o. combined yellow
fever and smallpox. K -'titeen caotairis of

SCABS DRIVEN INTO THE SWAMP.
Railroad Employe* at Little Rock Take
Xon-l aiun Men OAT a Train.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. I.—There w.u
great excitement in railroad circles here
today over the ejection of a car load of
"scab" railway employes en route from
Indianapolis and Louisville to relieve the
strike on the Arkansas Pass railroad.
The railway men had learned of their
coming, and when the train arrived a
large crowd was congregated at the depot.
One man shouted to '"cut the hose and
drop the car out," and the air-brake hose
was severed in an instant. When
the train started up, the mob hav
ing failed to disconnect the engineer's
signal cord, the bell in the cab rang
and the train stopped again. By this
time ail the engine whistles in the yard
had began to blow, and it seemed as
though bedlam had broken loose. A hun
dred men rushed into the sleeper, driving
the occupants, some forty telegraph oper
ators, machinists and train hands, from
the car and into the swamps near by.
Most of them were driven into a pond,
through which they floundered, followed
by the infuriated men. The sleeper was
re-coupled to the train and crossed
the river into Little Rock,
where another crowd of men
boarded it and with knives cut to shreds
ail the bajiKaire of the unfortunates. J. H.
Littlelield, who was in charge of the party
of new men, with several of his compan
ions escaped and took the train for Texas,
while others of the party are still hiding
in the swamps awaiting an opportunity ta
escape.
The railroad authorities are enraged at
the action of their employes. The various
railroad labor unions are strong in sympa
thy with their .striking brethren in Texas,
and it is a wonder the new men escaped
severe personal injuries.
