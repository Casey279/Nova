ViMISGTOS AT THE WORLD'S

Those •who are fancier with the work
i«omplisbed give t.-.e r.at
p"eparations for an exhibit
at tbe World's lair are further advanced
than those of ar:y other Hate. It is evi
dent that the work done f>r Washington
is being done tystematicaliy, thoroughly
end faithfully, and that the resources of
this state wil! be properly set forth to the
world at the ereat exposition.
It is fortunate that the p-eparalion of
Washington's exhibit has r**n intrusted
to such eood hands. A poor exhibit
would do the state incalcula ie injury. A
gooi one will undoubtedly oe of tje great
est sdvant.z* to t. It i» en ou for
the people to feel that the m oney w.- ; ich
t »T h.we rv'-n for this purpose is being
honestly an i intelligently appl.ed, and
that the exhibit of Washington will oe
one of which no state in tne Union should
be ashamed.

The content for the Ohio senatorshfp
between Senator Sherman end ex-Gov
ernor Foraker will probably be an ex
ceed nirly close one. For a tune it was
believed tbat Sherman's re-t.ect.on was
assured. but Foraker has apparently
made inroads on the strength of his
comoetitor. for the Sherman managers
now exhibit some alarm. Senator Sher
man has left Washington City, contrary
to his expressed intention, and is now at
Columbus manaeing his own campaign.
Ex-Governor Foraker s supporters num
ber many of the most active and enthusi
astic members of the Republican p*rty of
Ohio. He is a great favorite with the
younr men of his state, and it is the
younger element which supports him,
even against so able a statesman as John
Sherman. This active and energetic sup
port is certain to make his candidacy
formidable. It is probable, too, that Sen
ator Sherman's cause has suffered because
of the illness of Secretary Foster, who is
Lis earnest supporter, aod who is by all
odds the shrewdest and most powerful
politician among the Ohio Republicans.
Tbe Republicans of other states ear
nestly hope that Senator Sherman wiil be
re-elected, though they admire Governor
Foraksr's pluck, ability and manliness.
Whether the latter wins or loses this f.ght
he is one of the coming leaders of the
p*-ty.
C HII.E I!f OCR CIVIL WAR.
It is worth recalling today that during
the civil war, when our nation was strug
gling desperately for life, the republic of
Ch. e was our enthusiastic friend. Her
jeople contributed more money to the
sanitary commission for the benefit of
Northern sick and wounded soldiers than
was sent fur a like purp >e through all
the other legations of th* government
combined. The Chilean auth unties, more
over, at that very time of our history
cheerfully acknowledged sn 1 paid w:th
interest a large claim that had originally
bffi preferred their government
by ours as early as Wl9. Colonel Thomas
H. Nelson, who was the American min
ister at Santiago, said at the recent annual
dinner of tne Indiana commandery of the
Loyal Legion:

THE DEMOCRATIC TARIFF FIGHT.
Speaker Cr:«p is unfairly denounced by
the friends of Mil's of Tt xas because he
did not aj; int that gentleman to the
head of the ways and means committee.
Mr. Crisp due- n. i bel.eve in the free trad#
issue pnsinUHl by Mr. Cleveland in his
iwessace of IN*?, and embodied by Mr.
Mil.s in bis celebrated tariiT measure of
iss.*. Mr. Mills has advanced bevond bis
position of ar.d now declares for ab
solute free trade and an income tax. Mr.
Crisp, like Springer of Illinois Hill and
liorman, is in favor of tar.if revision
and reform, but he is not a freetrader;
and as the exponent of what he believes
sound tariff policy he has appointed
Springer instead of Mills chairman of the
ways and means committee. Mr. Springer
Is. reported by the correspondent of the
iVmocratic Brooklyn Juiy.'e as savin?r
If we can do tsothin* else than five wool on

This is a moderate programme compared
wtth the Mills-Cleveland proposition of
taritf re*»eal and the enactment of fre*
tra ie. The views of Springer are sup

Raleigh .Yewi, Atlanta Au

out :r» discussing the New Orleans massacre,
where the local courts and police and

the states having been debarred from in

the mo-al accountability of Louisiana
practically devolved upen the Federal
F vernment. as was the case ia the Wy>

gress toeaa'-t legislation that would make
such accountability effective, and the New
York Surt (Democratic) commends this
recommendation of President Harrison
and Secretary Blai ne, saying:

But Chile is a union of states under a
feieral constitution; sae is a eovereirn
state, and there is not the slightest evi
dence that there is to be any such failure
of justice in h*r court- as was exhibited by
the paralysis of the judicial machinery of
the state of Louisiana.
If Chile should deny us resort to her
courts; if. a-> in Louisiana, the courts re
fuse to investigate through the failure of
the grand jury to indict, why then there
would be some just fication for the scream
ing flight of the American easle that has
been exhibited by the correspondent of
the Teltgraph, who evidently supposes
that ignorance and arrogance are all that
are e-sential to an effective discussion of
the Chilean difficulty. That correspondent,
when the Chilean difficulty is settled, will
probably know more than he did when he
began to denounce the views of the I'OST
ISTSLLIGEXCER, and he will do well to
remember one thing, viz., that a difference
of opmion upon a public question between
two fair minded men never demands inso
lent or discourteous language, or disre
spectful imputations. It is quite possible
for a man to dider from his neighbor and
nut be ether a coward, or a fool or a knave,
but the correspondent of the Ttbgraph
b»gan Lis criticism of the POST-ISTELLI
gem eh by assuming tnat its editor was "a
coward and an ignoramus" because he
rec.ted w hat are the c_>l! facts in the Chile
ca*e. I >rtunately for the peace of nations,
the wishes of the correspondent of the
Telegraph are not the fathers of the law
and international practice throughout the
world; if they were the United States
would be: rne what John Randolph called
England, "the game cock of the century."
The oricrin of the Teltyraph correspon
dent s a- surd theory of American sailors'
rights on shore in foreign countries reca-.s
the story of the boy who sai 1 he "made
his top all ou; of his own head, and had
wood enough left to make another." It
seems that the government of Chi.e did
express without delay, in f.tting terms, its
regret for the Baltimore aifray, but this
expression of regret, whi.e coaimunicaud
to Minister Ear&n, was not transmitted by
him by telegraph but was received at
Washington on the 224 ult. by mad, so
that President Harrison was ignorant of
its existence when he wr te his messace.
MR. BLAISE AND THE r RESIDENCY.
The conviction has now lecome general
that Mr. Blaine wili not refuse to become
the Republican cand; iate for the presi
dency. It s the accepted belief in politi
cal circles that, unie-s his health changes
materially for the worse in the mean
time. he wi.l accept the standard whu~h
the Minneapolis convention will place in
his hand, and w.li aitam be in name, as he
has ions been in fact, the peer-ess leader of
hi« party.
With Mr. Blaine's attitude thus under
stood, there can be no doubt of the action
of the national convention. It is safe to
sav that Mr. lllaine is the choice of four
fifths of the Republicans of the country.
It is equally safe to say that in every state
of the Union, with the possible exception
of Indiana a large majority of the Repub
licans earnestly desire his nomination.
Against such popular strength wire-pull
ing ar. i secret machinations by federal
office-holders car. avail nothing.
As to Mr. Blaine s strength before the
people there can be no question. He w.U
unite the Republican party as it has not
been united s.uce lv« 0. Kvery Republican
fee s, and every Democrat fears, that he
will carry New York by an overwhelming
majority, no matter who the Democratic
candidate cay te. The feeling among
New York Republicans is expressed by
Richard Marcy, an old lire Stalwart at-.d
in the past a strong anti-Plaine man. Ia
a recent interview he sa.d: '"Blaine has

HILL'S L1 8 T jr JtP.
Uaifed States Senator Hill. of New
York, has evidently discovered that the
free silver speech he delivered December 5
at Err. ~a is rot a- cepcable to the honest
money De m -crati of the Umpire state,
who *ere educated in hiar.ee 1y Ti.den,
Manning a* d Baada'l, so in his fareweh
? peech at Alba:r the night bed: re New
Year's he declared against free silver
coinage, and calls
arid sliver united at a fixed ratio in free
hi-aietai-ic '.•viaare wi;h a paper currency.
wa.ah is a cer.iiicate of deposit of either
coir..''
But Senator Hill, while hs advises
aga.ast :he passige of a free c inare bill
far es the rep-eal of the Saeraaaa sr. of
Jaly 14, liOO. sad the renewing fjr the
present of the B.ani *iw of L-Ti. aeaatcr
H.ii Will had oat that a good many h'aest
money Democrats do not favor the repeal
of the Sherman act of Jz'.y 14, L?X\ aader
the pro of which the United states
r vemmeat parrhases 4.y/ "00 ounces cf
i .rer ev»ry aad iaaaea treasury
a ; :<~s therefor.
Jacob H, Schiff, of the f rra of Kafcn,
± Co., of New York ctty, is a Dem>
crat of high dirt.nction in f naatia. cir
cles, aa I in the December For'um
he deaoances the action of the
New York Ch amber of Commerce
in demanding the repeal of the silver
iiw of ISiO aad suggesting nothing in its
place except the B.anl art of liTT*. Mr.
Jrchiff" ;hc»ws that the Sherman Republican
t-lver law of 1-30 is better than the Bland
act of I-"?, because it no Ic-nger comr-eis
the coiaare of light-weight s..ver dollars,
bat provides for ihe iasaance of a treasary
note Laiei upon a hundred cents worth of
si.ver ta.lion. Mr. Schiff" points oat that
if the art cf lr •') were repea.e>d, under
aboai $5,000.000 cf treasary notes are
issued monthly, the volame of the car
re aO7 woaid be contracted, which, with
the certainty of a contraction throagh the
decrease in the national bank note circu
lation and an increasing j>opalat:on,
would not be g»i policy.
Measured by sound economic principles,
the passage of tae Bland silver law of IrT?,
directing the coinage of siiTer dollars of a
debased intrinsic value, and the creation
of certificates based upon this coinage,
was indefensible, and Mr. fee hi f holds
that the iaw of IS-0, which has pracricaiiy
stopped this coinage of the dollar of
smaller in valae than the face of the car
rer.cy it represents, authorizes treasary
notes which are vastly more desirable
than the si.ver certincates created by the
Bland law of 1»7?.
Mr. SchiiJ makes it clear that it would
be exceedingly bad finance to repeal the
act of IrsCO without hrst devising a sabsti
tate for the circulating notes which it
authorizes. For the present and until a
safe and satisfactory substitute can be
found for our fast disappearing bank note
circulation, a repeal of the Sherraaa act of
July, IS*), does not apacar desirable, but
Mr. Schid would modify it by making
treasury notes redeemable in silver bullion
at its market value, or in gold at the op
tion of the government, upon the plan
proposed by the late Secretary Windom,
waile a minimum gold reserve should by
law be established, in prescribed propor
tion to the treasury's stock of silver; so
that in any event the srovemment shall be
at all times in a position to protect the
standard of alt lis note issues.
In opposition to Senator Hill's proposed
repeal of ;he Republican Sherman act of
July, «), and the renewal for the present
of the light-weight silver dollar B.and act
of 1 ; 73, Mr. Schirf says:
To demerid, u ha# been done, au imraeiiat*
repeal of the existia? IST, W;:hou: pointing out
or even discussing economic measures to be en*
acted preceding a repeal, will cot only lead to
caught, bat is likely to create se<*t: oaal feeiisg

from a Kitieat the sustaining medicine. pennit-
hire to sink near unto death, before dis
euss.ng and er leavoring to find the relief meas
ures through which it would become poss.ble to
effect a permanent cure.
Senator H i has evidently attempted an
other Cnan-ial somersault and has for the
second time landed on his head.
THE KANSAS SEXATORSHIP.
Governor Humphrey, of Kansas, has ap
pointed ex-Hepresentative Bishop W.
Perkins to £2l the unexpired term of the
late Senator Piumb. Mr. Perkins served
for eight years in the House of Represent
atives, but was overwhelmed in the tidal
wave of 1590, having been defeated by the
candidate of the Farmers' Alliance. His
congressional career wis creditable but
by no means brilliant. It affords no
ground for the belief that he will tuke
even so high a place in the Senate *3 was
occupied : v Senator Plumb. His general
record is excellent. He stands well among
the lawyers of Kansas, and he served with
credit in the Union ar:i:v.
The appointment of Senator Perkins
ends a senatorial contest which was, to
say the least, unique. The power of
naming the senator rested with Governor
Humphrey alone, but the friends of a
number of the candidates opened head
quarters at Topeka and advocated their
favorites precisely as if they had been pre
paring to capture a caucus or a conven
tion. These metnods are said to have dis
gusted Gtffern: r Humphrey, and it is pos
sible that it was beca .se of them that he
passed over the m< re prominent can li
dates and selected a man whose name was
not at first mentioned in connection with
the vacancy.
The spp intment of Senator Perkins
makes it certain that, at least for a time,
ex-Senator Incalls must cont.nue to be "a
statesman out of a job."
A "cording to the report of a Philadelphia cor
respondent w„o writes from w*«h:agton City,

THE STATE PRESS.
Spokane CSronwie (Bern.): "There is a ?row-
Irg impression 1.1: the 'prominent polit.cian
wh'se su:3n?3'j concerning Mr. B.aine wrald
t>e accepted without question were h.s san: re
vealed." is the present secretar> of state.''
Ceatn.it .Vnu: '-It is said that if proper in
ducements were held out to the Port T>wnsend
Southern that road would extend its line from
T=Uino to Central.a and thence east towarlthe
new m.ning district. Isn't there sone way of
finding out wnat Mr. Suutn would consider
'proper inducements?* "
Pert Townsead Ltaier: "The fear 1831 hai
been one of prosperity to not: sections of
America, and one of adversity to mo«t of
E- r pe. Here peace and plenty hare prevailed,
while acres! the Atlantic the dsra clouds of
war have hidden the flal suash ne that should
hare blessed th *e jealous, fretful nations, and
want and poverty hare saddened me year for
many of the less favored c assee."
Spokane Spokerxcm: "The farmers of East
ern Washington haTe an opportunity to
in a bu«,ne*s that is at once proitable and
certain. There » a deartn of horses for cavalry
purpose in Europe, and the opnion is ex
pressed by experts that American breeders mar
in time control the world's narset lor h rses
of every description. It is conceded that in
case of a E w-.r, which may occur at
any moment, and is almost certain to happen
before tne cl se of the century. Europe won.d
be forced to crarv heavily on this country for
her horses for military purposes."
A QCESTIOX OF EXPENSE.
OITOPIA, Dec. Tl, I?9L
To THE Enrro*: The trial of the ca>e of the
f ate Alhertaon is set for January 11,
1' 2. at Olyrnp.x It comes on a change of
venue fr m P.erca county, and is liable to b»
an expense of seven ore.-'ht thousand dollars.
Th. qUMtion Out s n>w ajritat-irr oar tax
payers is, Will Thurston or Pierce county hav
to stand this great exner.se? Times are close
w.:h u«. and we do not want to pay the de k ts
of Pierre countv. But the more serious rfcase
of the matter pr .-sents itself thus: If Tfcurs:- a
county pays a_y >f this expense, can she com
pel P.erca c ;nty to reimburse her? .'s there
any statute that will compel the latter to stand
such expense? Some claim that there is cot,
and an effort !« t-:ing mad? to procure the
oplni n of the attorney-general as to the actual
status of the laws of tt:is state resrari:n? this
particular su ;»cn Oar*cous;y coma sstoners
are very uneasy over the matter. lIEACxa.
