FOOTBALL AT TACOMA
Jortlaud Wins After a Hard
Struggle by Score of 24 to 0.
THE BULL PUP MASCOT TO BLAME

TACOHA, Jan. I.—-[Special.]—The return
amateur football game between the Mult
nomah Athletic Association, of Portland,
snd the Tacoma Athletic Association, of
tfti* citv. was won this afternoon by the
former by a score of 24 to 0. Fully 2,500
people witnessed the struggle, which began
»i 1:45 and ended at 3:40 p. m. The society
r people and athletes generally of Tacoma,
and a large delegation of athletes from
I Portland, and a small contingent from
Seattle were present. To the credit of the
Tacoma Athletic Association it must in
Justice be said that the best of order was
maintained throughout.
As the game progressed the enthusiasts
could not kept in the grand stand, and
they swarmed about the lines along the
west and east ends of the league baseball
pounds, on Eleventh street, where the
jpiine took place. Portland was decidedly
well represented by young men with
strong lungs, who yelled and blew on lish
horns and kazoos, making the most dis
cordant sounds. The yell of the victors
was "'Rah, 'Rah, Mult-no-mah 1" and
every person within the radius of a mile
beard it. The yellers and horn-blowers
made the best of their abilities and cheered
their men vehemently at times.
Portland had a mascot, also. This mas
cot was a great deep-chested gray and
white bull pup which, like the umall
fcatared colored boy in charge of him,
was decorated with red, white and blue
ribbons. The objects at both ends of the
chain which united them took great inter
as: in the game. The thin breast of the
colored boy. whose name is 1! asm us, swelled
a little each time the visitors scored a
touch-down.
Mack and cream were the Tacoma col
ors, and their call was of the Si wash
tongue : '*Wah-hoo-wah-wah-hoo-wah-
T»ck-o-in»h !"
Owing to the fact that the game was
pi.3yed under protest, the Tacoma Athletic
Association proposes to request the trus
tees of the Tacoma, Seattle, Spokane and
Portland associations to pass upon the
question of the debarring of Pope today.
It is expected that the protest will be al
lowed and that the game will be played
over here, w lien, if Pope, Phil Anderson
and Carter p;ay, it is believed that Tacoma
wili stand a fair show of winning.
A slight controversy at the conclusion of
the game, when Trewett cutoff Brooke's
matfniticent run by a clever tackle, has
been developed by repetition into a sensa
tional fetury ot having concluded in a
fight.
One of the Portland team created a sen
sation at the Tacoma theater tonight by
Starting the Multnomah yell. He was
quieted, due allowance being made for the
high spirits of the visitors over their vic
tory.
The teams and positions are as follows:
ilfteoma. Volition. Portland.

The game opened with the trains lined
•p. But it was noticed that the Portland
j tsotain failed to give hi men the signal
to play. Savage motioned bis men off
the rield, and an nngentlemanly and dis
fraceful exhibition was given by their
runts!n. He refused to play as long as
Pope was on the lield, contending that
he (Pope) was a professional and, there
fore, making himself and the players pro
fessionals by playing against him. The
esse of a Princeton baseball player play
ing a whole season in the New York
National league and then going back to
.Princeton and the University of Penn
sylvania wa« cited to the disgruntled
captain, but lie stolidly refused to play,
Slid Pope was compelled to leave the
' field. The rank injustice of the kick was
Tery apparent. As the game drew along
Pope's presence was badly needed, for
blocking and interference, and with his
well-known ability in that line, Kershaw
•lid Simpson would have played
• much finer game. Kershaw repeatedly
Mid that he could not play his position
with that confidence that Pope's presence
Would have given him. After the play
was started Referee Jacobs' wretched de
cisions made the home team wince and
long wrangles followed some outrageous
decisions.
The Portlands, with the exception of
lour or live players, are little phort of
roughs, and language, actions and appear
ance were certainly against them today.
On a scrimmage, :n which Simpson had
M' ire.l the hall and had cried down, two
of the Portland team deliberately fouled
bim. with the result of breaking two bones
in his ankle, and he had to be carried off
iKe field.
Dudley got an ugly cut on his forehead
bv some underhand work in an early
•criminate, and Trevvett took his place.
The Portlands' play was superior all
•round to that of the Tacomas'. They
•mj loved the we 1 c a'most continuously,
*n.l srut tlie hull-necked Kandall through
boles in the center and guard for most of
their gains. I'inpire Wiestling distin

leaving only the red and white stripes. A
most important member of the party was
Ben, a brindie buiidog, who was gavlv

The necessary noise of such an outfit was

Frank K.Atkins who defeated Ed C.
Sharp yesterday at the Y. M. C. A. gym
nasium in a high jumping contest, is one
of the nnest ail-round athletes on the Pa
cihe coast. He not only holds the cham
pionship of the association for high jump
ing, but also wears a go.d medal which he
captured for the best all-round work at
the \. M. C. A. field sports. In addition
to excelling in jumping lie is a leader in
vaulting, sprinting and other lines of ath
letic work, is an excellent basebali and
tennis player, and a first-class shot. His
competitor young Sharp has also some most
excellent materia) in him, and with age
and experience is bound to make his mark.
His practice work in high jumping was
generally thought to excel that of Atkins,
but in a public contest the youngster seems
to lose confidence, and certainly does not
do himself justice. With the overcoming
of tins fault he would rank with the best.
Gisbert Waescher, of Alexandria, Minn.,
will attempt to ride horseback around the
world in 500 days. Waescher proposes to
start from Chicago on February 1, 1892.
His route will be from Chicago to New
\ ork and then to Havre, France. He ex
pects to reach France in March. Waescher
will then ride from Havre to Berlin via
Paris, and then to Moscow. Russia, which
place he expects to reach in June. From
there he will proceed to Russian Si
beria, then to Western China, and
then to Pekin. He expects to rearh
the Chinese capital in February, I*!l3.
He will then put his horse on board a
steamship and proceed to San Francisco.
He will cross the Rocky mountains over
the old Pacific trail to Chicago, where he
expects to arrive in July. Waescher
stands 6 feet 2 inches in height and weighs
183 pounds. He was born in the province
of Westphalia, Germany, on January 8,
18.VJ. He will tak>* his own horse for the
journey, and expects to bring it back to
exhibit at the World s fair, if the animal
survives the trip.
The international tug-of-war,over which
the people of San Francisco went wild,
has proven a failure in New York city.

The Cartaret Club and several represen
tatives of the New York daily press are at
loggerheads over an alleged breach of
faith of the latter in publishing an ac
count of a shooting match on the club's
grounds. The rules of the club positively
forbid any reports of shooting on the
grounds. The reporters were informed of
this fact and requested to make no men
tion of the match in their papers, but were
asked to remain and witness the shooting
as guests of the club. They remained, but
the next day their papers had a full report
of the shooting. Hereafter the Cartaret
Club grounds will be closed to newspaper

AFTER GARZA'S MEN.
Rangers. Marshals, Deputy
Sheriffs and Soldiers Out.
LIKE HUNTING PRAIRIE DOGS.
The Guerrillas Take to Their Holes at
the First Alarm—Their Signal
Service Well Organized.
Rio GRANDE CITY, Jan. 2.—[St Louis Re
public Special.]— Captain ilardie reports
by courier: "I struck the camp of about
2 IJO of Garza's men on the 29th uit., at
sundown in a dense chaparral near
Garcia's ranch, with no casaulties on our
side. Cantain Brooks' company of rang
ers and Troop A of the Third cavalry.
Lieutenants Beach and Short, are with
me. Captains Bourke and McKay are
also here as volunteers."
Captains Bourke and McKay returned
to this place last night, and the following
report was made to department head
quarters:
Ifsrdie has a comnany of Texas Rangers and a
force of deputy marshals under Deputy Marshal
Van Riper, a posse under Sheriff Hames, of
Carrisso, and some Mexican trailers, sent by
General Garcia, of tho Mexican army. Two
companies under Beach and Short are just
down irosn San Antonio. The bandits are
scattered in the chaparral, aud I do not
think they will tight, much less caught in the
toils. McKay and 1 left this morning after a
fight, aud cam* back across to Pinerno, twenty
Bides, aud back of some ranches. The great
danger is that these bandits will break
into small squads and plunder travelers.
They have a perfect organization, a good system
of signal*, know the country, aud being without
uniforms can turn into innocent rangers and
herders in a few minutes. There is great need
of wagons and trailers who know the country
and people.
In the opinion of army officers there
should be a general round-up of ranchers
from Polisto Bianco west. Hardie
marched his command from 3 a. m. until
sundown of the 29th, over Jiftv miles, but
it was impossible to bring the outlaws to
bay in the darkness. Captain Neil's com
pany of rangers arrived last night from
Alice. Captain Brito, of the rangers,
telegraphs from Edinburg, llfty miles
south:
An armed party is at Arguellas. twenty miles
below here. Sheriff Oiousner and myself, in
combination with Colonel Mauero's cavalry, will
raid them tomorrow night. Can you or a deputy
marshal, with CDited States troops, meet us to
morrow at Edinburg?
The lilatico is very wide, and a lar«e
number of men are needed to guard the
river front. It seems Garza is making no
attempt to cross into Mexico, but is col
lecting his forces on this side to defy the
United States troops. Several outlaws
who crossed the river and one of Captain
Brito's prisoners that escaped and swain
the river were captured by Mexican sol
diers yesterday and are now in jail.
A detachment of troops arrived this
morning with Sexto Longoria, a prisoner,
severely wounded in the leg, which will
necessitate amputation. He was shot in
the recent fight between United States
troops and bandits, and is one of the
men who invaded Mexico with Garza
in his lirst raid. He lives at La Gruella
ranch. He was formerly a United States
deputy marshal, and is now reported to be
prominent among the insurgents. Cap
tain Bourke and an "escort left with the
prisoner this afternoon for Brownsville.
An attempt will bo made by United
States troops, rangers and Mexicans to
night to surround and capture Blanco, in
which there is congregated quite a party
of revolutionists and outlaws.
LATER —A squad of McNeill's rangers
had a rousing light with a small party
about ten miles from here this afternoon.
He succeeded in capturing one of their
horses. About 300 shots were fired, but no
rangers were injured. The loss on the
other side is not reported.
SAN ANGELO, Tex., Jan. 1. —It is re
ported that large numbers of Mexicans
working on ranches south of here are
quitting work to enlist with Garza. They
are now well armed.
HAS ANTONIO, Jan. I.—[New Orleans
Ficaijunr Special.]— The total number of
United States troops in the turbulent ter
ritory, looking alter Garza, will be about
1,000 men, when those who go out tomor
row reach tbe scene. Garza has spies in
this city who keep him fully posted of
every maneuver, and if tbe rumored
revolt of the soldiers at Mier proves
correct it is believed the population of
Northern Mexico will dock to his standard
rapidly. The recent persecution of Cath
olic priests has heightened the disaffection
toward the Diaz government, and all
the people are waiting for a chance
to join any revolutionary movement
if the prospects are for success.
Garza is known to have a force of 500 des
perate men, and if the 1,000 Mexican
troops who are reported to have murdered
and deserted General Lorenzo Garcia, com
mander at Mier, have made their way to
(iarza's stronghold on the Texas side,
their united force would give liourke a
hard light. It would not be im
possible for Garza, with a force
of I.'JOO men, to capture Fort
and the whole {<>:•*" of United
Stutt-s troops in that section ■ >f the frontier..
He has threatened on several occasions to
take Fort Ringgold it it becomes necessary
f>r him to get food and military supplies.
It an opportunity has occurred it is not
improbable that he has executed his
threat. General Stanley will send two
more troops of cavalry t® the scene of the
disturbance tomorrow.
CITY or MEXICO, Jan. I.—Telegrams re
ceived today say that the force of revolu
tionists which a few days ago uttaoked a
body of United States soldiers numbered
only ten men.

SNOHOMISH'S PROGRESS IN 1891.
Much Building and Other Improvements
—Railroad Rushing Work.
SNOHOMISH, Jan. I.—[Special.)—Mativ things
occurred during the first half of the past
year to indicate that the growth of this place
during the year 1891 would be less than the av
erage of the three preceding years of ISSS,
and 1890. The first of la>t January a great
amount of building was in progress. Probably
*•30,000 was expended in completing building's
begun in 18H0. Blackmail's mills turned out but
little lumber in the spring, the Everett boom
unsettled things to a certain extent, and before
any extensive new work was under way the
burning of the Blackman mills last June seemed
to make certain a small development for the
whole year. This lasted but for a short time.
Iti the ordinary sense of the term, there never
has been a "boom" at Snohomish, Thus far all
its progre-s has been permanent and substan
tial. Few lots have ever been sold and no
buildings have ever been built except for imme
diate use. Soon men began to hustle them
selves, as the necessity for more business houses
and dwellings became apparent. All the re
maining sawmills started up, up Pillchuck, on
Lake Stevens and at Cathcart, and what lumber
they could not furnish was shipped in from Se
attle or from miils along the railroad between
here and there. Ever since the first of July the
greatest activity in building and other improve
ments has been manifested. The city and
county have grown together and the city govern
ment has continued the work of public im
provement throughout the whole year. Kail
roads have been active indeed the paEt year, and
they promise to do greater things next year; so
that, ail in all, the prospects of Snohomish city
and enohom.sh county us well were never as
bright as they are today.
Some of the leading improvements may be
summarized for the year 189! as follows:
Street grading doue, I'laskett contract....sls,OTO
Street grading doue, Cyphers contract 7,50t)
Bridge and approaches across Snohomish
river IS,OOO
Bridge and approaches across I'illchuck.. I,'xia
Business houses, Hagertvs block, etc ... 10,000
Business houi-es, Kirk's blick 3.U00
Business houses, F. Ferguson's three
stores and bakery 3,."i00
Busiuess houses. Burton's block. 2,500
Business houses, Patterson's block 2,503
Business houses, F. Eiwell block 2,500
Business houses, Gett'esohn's block 2,-">o3
Business houses, McGinnis' block 2,30J
Mis» Churchiil's block of eight two-story
tenements 6.500
Two new school houses S.OOO
Electiic light improvements 3,000
Judge r>.*any's residence 4,.">00
Studing's residence 2,600
Swordtigure's residence 3,000
Warner's residence 2,000
The above represent only some of the leading
Improvements. Many minor business house--,
improvements and additions have been made,
as well as over 100 residences have been built
this year. The Piaskett street contract is still
unfinished. The above is the amount done in
ls'Jl. The tola. building improvement the past
year is fully ?2">0,000.
The three "S' railroad is proparly a local en
terprise. But for the non-arrival of iron for
bridges it would ha\e been completed to Everett
some months a~o. This iron it now being re
ceived, the rest of the road is about completed,
and it will all be finished within a few weeks,
at a total cost of about $250,000.
The men forming the Kirkland Lumber Com
pany, under a new name, are putting up a steam
sawmill, capacity 100,0u0 feet of lumber in
twelve hours, at tho upper end of town, on the
nortn bauk ot the river, just below the mouth of
tho I'illchuck. This will probably cost as much
and be as large as the Blackman mills when
completed.
it is expected that in 1592 something like the
following sums will be expended at thiß place:
Street improvements $ 25,000
Motor lino to Everett 100,000
N''W sawmill 100,000
New furniture factory, 3'J,000
smelter works 27,0<0
Press brick plant 12,<M)
Foundry lo.ooi)
Ebey island dyke, five miles downriver.. 42,000
Total *315,000
railroads.
Railroad development has been active the
past year throughout Snohomish county. Tho
Seattle <fc Montana iias spent in the county fl,-
500.010; the three "S" road, S2jO,OCO.
In 1892 the Great Northern will employ 5,000
men in building from Everett by Snohomish
city to Steven's pass, in the Cascade mountains.
This is a distance of some eighty mites, and
they wid spend $;i,200,000. Their branch to Sil
ver Creek mines will cost J.'iOO (SO. Tho proposed
railroad from Getchell to tho Monte Cristo
mines may cost |2,000,000. T>build it will need
■ay 4,000 men next summer. The three "S"
road may build eastward from Snohomish next
season, and the result is that from f5,000,0u0 to
ft},ooo,o*o may be expended in 1592 in railroad
construction in Snohomish county.
DKTLOKABI.R FEI'U IN TACOMA,
Editors Begin the New Year Quarreling
Ofcr Private Affairs.
Tacoma News. December 29.
Information has reached the S'ews that the
e liter of a morning newspaper in this city is
going about endeavoring to enlist the aid of the
enemies of a rival editor in a sehame to buy up
the bills of the latter and como down upon him
and force him to the wall. This is the act of a
hound. If the business men of this city find
that their creditors are pressing them, they will
know who ii responsible.
Tucoma G1 >be. Dec. 20.
If this "warning" is intendei for the G'obe we
have to express our gratitude for this evidence
of fraternal solicitude, but really it is unneces
sary. The Glob* has received most ungenerous,
unfair and unjust treatment from its new»-
paper rivals, such treatment as the Giobe under
no circumstances would demean itself to
reHirn in kind. This paper, Its editor and
its fr.ends have been attacked publicly and pri
vately. No attempt has teen spared to ruin the
Globe and drive it from the held. It is f>ossibla
that the warning of the A etvt may have some
foundation, and that some such pian may be in
pro*p« <t. It would require very littie money to
carry out the first part of it. So far as
we know, "to buy up all the bills of the
e litor" would require ai: expenditure of very
lew cents, while we have yet to learn tnat any
bill against the Giobe has been reiu>«d payment
Nor cau we understand just how a "rival editor"
can "enlist the ai l of the enemies of the
editor" of the Oiobe, for we have no
reason to believe that such "enemies '
exist, save in the imagination of our so
licitous contemporary. Is any such
scheme as this is proposed, it wiJ effect the
G'obe only as fund for genuine amusement. Is it
not a little too severe for the -Vu« to intimate
that its a.ly, Iriend ana business assoc.ate is at
tempung "the •( t of » houml?" Keai;v there is
110 need o{ such emphatic utterance. The
phrase s» ou* which no gcnt.einan would apply
t > another. There is no reason why au editor
should not be fi g.nt.t-ruan.

A Notable Hou*e.
New York Letter.
In spite of the so-catlel ''palatial resi
dences," including the Vanderbilt man
sions, and Stewart's, before it became a
club house, with other pretentious places
that might be named, by far the finest
house in Fifth avenue has stood for years
on the corner of Fifty-seventh street. Its
claim to this distinction is that, with all
its architectural beauty, its magnitude and
its commanding position on two streets,
it has the charm, which no amount of
mere money can give, of beins a perfect
"home." Within and without it is a thor
ough exponent of an exquisitely refined
taste. And fittingly so now, lor it is
owned and occupied l y ex-Secretary Whit
ney. who. witu hi* wife, makes that home
the scene of graceful living and gracious
hospitality. It is one of the landmarks of
real refinement on that avenue. This
noble house which years ago cost $2,000,000
—it is worth more now—came into the
hands of the present owner for one-half
that sum; and the astonishing thing about
it is that it was originally built by a woman
who—well, she had a good architect and
good advisers in the matter of decorating
and furnishing. She was the daughter of
an old merchant, Josiah Sampson, of whom
little was known till only thirty-tive years
ago. when lie suddenly" emerged to the
surface as the rich, very rich, Josiah
Sampson—a strong enough Satnusuii
for the Four Hundred, anyhow. He
was only one of the many
founders of "old families"—that is,
3-5, or less, years old—in the same
smart set. The daughter married a
handsome, well-mannered young law
yer, "Fred" Stevens, his intimates
called him, and wheu the beauti
ful house was built it was known
and long known as the Stevens house.
There was another charming residence in
Newport. In that seaside town Mrs.
Stevens obtained a divorce from her hus
band on easy ground of "non-sup
port." Nobody supposed from the dav of
his marriage that he supported her. But
there was a French Marquis de Taliey
rand-Perigord, a descendant of the disre
putableold diplomatist who originally bore
the title. He had before favored this coun
try with his presence and had married a
rich woman in Boston. As he wanted to
marry the rich Mrs. Stevens, while
she in Newport got a divorce, he, in
Paris, procured a divorce from his wife,
possibly on the ground of "non-support."
All this was less than four years Mrs.
Stevens obtained her share of the Tallev
rand-Perigord title, hut the due got none
of the Sampson fortune, which was secured
to the Stevens chi.dren. Within a week
the "Duchess de Dino," as she is by her
Talley rand-Perigord marriage, lias con
ben ted to permit her daughter, Mabel
Stevens, to drop to a countess, and a Polish
countess at that. Mabel's husband's name
isOrlowski, and the granddaughter ol old
Josiah Sampson can claim, with her
mother, to belong to the "nobility." It is
a wonder that the late Count Johannes
was suffered to drag along here for years a
lone, lorn widower, and that Marquis de
Leuville was permitted to depart unmar
ried from our golden shores.
