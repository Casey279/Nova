of short duration, faowever. for an under

The fireman was discharged, it is

Colonel J. C. Haines* Condition
Still More CritieaL
TODAY MAY TELL THE TALE.
CoetalUtioß of Fosr Medical
51 -a to Tpo« Cosrw of
Treatment—Balletiaa.
I/urine yesterday the condition cf Col
one. J. C. Ha.ne? caaneed but "lightly,
yet that aiterat.on feerued to be for the
w rse. an i a: midn.eh: :ne doctors felt
that :he patient had hardly he.d h.s own
dn~:r.£r the twenty-four hoars preeedaeg.
Last evemr.2 there iu s consultation
between tne attendmc physicians. Dr. E.
L. Smith and Dr. Ruius Smith. Dr. P.us
se.l and Dr. Dawson. They agreed per
fectly as to the coarse of treatment, bat
the exact nature of the malady is a* yet
undetermined. Ihe troub.e bezan with a
s--Tere case of the zrip. toil • wed ty a strict
ure of the bowels. When the stricture
had been overcome some of the
symptoms of peritonitis set in. The
s* 2 men of tne is consi ieraoly
distended, and yet some of the common
features of peritonitis are lacking.
Daring a., of yesterday Co*onei Haines
was delirious. and a: times he suffered
much pain. In the afternoon he had sev
eral serere vomiting spell*. The treat
men: cons of administration of opi
ates and Light nourishment.
The doctors hoped tl»at during the nizht
Mr Haines would get a little rest and ra..y
t lay for a recovery. If the ra.»y does
n : t come by this afternoon, the worst may
be ext-ected.
About 1 o'clock Colonel Haines fell into
a deep sleep, which continued unti.. the
time of going to press. Tte attending
pcyiician said that the sleep would doubt
less be beneficial, but that the patient's
condition would remain in doubt until
this morning.
THREE ALARMS IX A3* HOUR.
Firemen Tarn Oat Three Times to So
Perpot*—Two Small Klaies.
The tire department was called out three
time' yesterday ;n a shorter space of time
proba- y than ever before. Tne tec-pie in
the burir.es- part of the city were hardly
settled down from the excitement of one
alarm. with the different pieces of appa
ratus thundering dowr. tr.e streets, than
an t .ercame. ihe engines. h; =e waror.s
and.a i : er trucks w*re ju-t oa tbe way as
after putting out a sin-.. hre, when a third
alarm brought nearly a.i of the rex a. air. g
apparatus down to the business street*, tbe
engines and hc«e wagons tearing mai.y
down the streets a third time within an
hour, end the second time within ten
minutes. When the engines came down
Second and Front streets, in response to
the third alarm, ar.d met the apparatus
return.ng from the second t.re. the hun
dred* of citizens on the streets saw nearly
the who!e department on parade.
The t.rst alarm came from box 42 and
wss caused by a blaze in room 13 of the
Northwestern hotel, at the corner of
Main and Commercial streets. The room
was unoccupied at the time, but it is sup
posed that some one in passing down the
hall threw a c.garette butt in the room
through the open door. Officer Os'oort
saw smoke rolling through the open win
dows and. hastily pulling in an alarm,
r .shed into the hotel and with the aid of
the «Jay clerk succeeded in putting out
the tire before the department arrived.
A bed which was ia the apartment was
burned an i the rarnet and furniture dam
aired to t. e extent of fIOO.
The «econ i alarm came in from box 55
at Fifth and Jackson streets. It was
turned in at 2:5$ p. m. for a hre in the
Peutschen house, a cheap lodging-house
over the Schooner saloon on King street,
between Sixth and Seventh. A few min
utes before the aiarm was turned in one of
the occupants of the upper door saw
smoke coming out of one of the rooms in
the rear of the building. Officers Mike
Powers and L. B. Pierce rushed up. and
with buckets of water, soon had the tire
under control, but only after three rooms
had been partially burned out. The fire
probably started from a ciear stub thrown
care.essly on a bed. which ignited the
mattres*. The loss will not amount to
more than sl«>">. The department arrived
about the time the hre was out.
The room in which this hre started is
the same in which Pave Denee, the cow
bow outlaw, was besieged by eight or ten
policemen for a whole night nearly two
years ago.
While turning in the signal for "fire
out" for the second fire, the hreraan a:
box 35 turned in by arc den; three taps of
the gong. That signal was taken as a spe
cial a arm and engines No. 1 and No. 4 and
hose cart No. 4 responded, arriving at Yes
ler avenue at the time when the other ap
paratus was returnine. Chief Kellogg
says tLa: he will censure the othcers of the
last-named companies for responding to
the three taps, as they were but two sec
onds apart, and the swcial alarm is three
taps with five seconds between. After
these three slow taps the number of the
box is to be sent in and this was not done
in the fii.se alarm to which the companies
responded.
BURNED BT A <HlilslMAS TREE.
l afortnnate End of a Happy Gathering
for W. f. Harper
W. P. Harper, secretary of the Seattle
Gas Company, was seriously burned by a
Christmas tri-e t«king tire in his residence

When the tree blazed up, some of the

A num:»er of other persons were in the

Considerably damaged by the blaze.

It is noted that advertisements of other baking
powders are filled with spleen, malice and mis
representation against the Royal, more than with
hones: claims as to their own goods.
That the Royal Baking Powder makes finer,
whiter, sweeter, more wholesome cooker}', the
ladies who have tried other kinds are willing to
testify and tell their neighbors; this fact is a
serious concern to all competitors.
The superb quality of the Royal Baking Pow
der, over and above all other kinds, is never so
manifest as when tried in comparison. It has
greater strength and does not deteriorate with
age, the last spoonful in the can being as good
as the first. All over this country the "Royal"
has the lead : this is whv makers of other brands.
J %
envious of its sale and popularity, talk so much
about it.
THE PASSING THRONG.
What the People Think About
and Talk Abont.
THE MONTE CRISTO RAILROAD.
A Feasible Route by the South Fork of
the »tillaxaami«b—Returning from
Ftirharfn Pert -3* l.
Mr. and Mrs. B. E. Palmer, of Fair
haven. are at the Grand hotel. Mr.
Palmer has just come down from the Cas
cade mountains, where he has been en
gaged in the survey for the proposed rail
road from the Monte Cristo mining dis
trict down the Sti.lazuainish river. He
sa.d last night: *T have been in chare?
of the party that was up in the
hills. We made a pretty careful
survey and found that for a mountain
road the grades will not be hard ones,
and the construction will be compara
tively easy.
"We also discovered that the route by
the south fork of the Stillaguamish will
be twelve miles shorter tr.3n by the north
fork and twenty miies shorter than by
tauk City."
A GREAT SCHOOL EXHIBIT.
Work Shown at Kairhaven ConTfntion
Promise# Well for World'* Fair.
One of the passeneers arriving on the
Premier from Fairhavt n last evening was
Edmond S. Meany, a«»istant to President
N. G. Biaiock. of the Washington World's
fair commission. He said:
"The exhibit of school work at the Fair
haven meeting of the State Teachers* As
sociation was a ereat surprise to me. It
included modelinz in clay. carving in
wood and colored soaps, paper weaving
andfoidinz. f.ne map drawing, excellent
papers on different lines of study, cabinet
work and other exhibits that would sur
prise any one not familiar with the mod
ern methods in public schools. Two store
rooms were hiled with these exhibits and,
if the exhibit for a state association meet
ing is so fears are entertained that
not enough space can be given for a com
plete exhioit at the Wor-d's fair.
"J. P. Hendricks was eminently success
fui in starting the work for the commis
sion. He says there will be no trouble in
securing a magnificent educational dis
play from this state. He has mapped out
work and secured promises to he p from
nearly all the principal educators of the
state. The convention was a spiendi 1 op
portunity to complete this preiminary
work, and by taking advantage of the oc
casion several thousand dollars were saved
for the state World's fair commission.
The teacher* were enthusiastic and will
all tate hold of the work and give their
time to it cheerfully. It is evident that
Washington will be able to surprise the
many visitors a: the Columbian exposi
tion by the evidence of the phenomenal
growth of her public school system."
Mr. Meany will next besm work on the
collection of statistics, and leaves this
morning for OlyjQpsa. where he w; 11 look
up the present facilities for collecting sta
tistical information, and supplement thtin
by a series of 1 lanks by »hich a complete
collection of the state statistics can be
made. This work will be done through
