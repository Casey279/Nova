" ASBIKGTON CITY, Jan. L.-Although the
custom has fallen into disuse elsewhere,
lierein \\ nshington City the social and
observance of New Year's calling
was maintained. The weather was favor
able, being cold and clear. The chief
events of the forenoon were a breakfast to
t&e diplomatic corps by Secretary Blaine
and a reception by President and Mrs.
garrison and the wives of the members of
the cabinet. The interior of the White
House was elaborately decorated for the
reception and the darkened rooms were
onght with the glare of electric lights.
President and Mrs. Harrison were assisted
in receiving by Mrs. Morton, Mrs. Elkins,
Mrs. Foster, Mrs. Wilmerding. Mrs. Noble
Mrs. Rusk. Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Wana
maker. Mrs. Blaine was unable to be
present because of ill health. A large
number of ladies were especially invited
to assist in entertaining such of the guests
as were asked behind the line. The recep
tion began promptly at 1 o'clock. The ar
rival ol the presidential party was an
nounced by the familiar air, "Hail to the
Chief." Vice-President and Mrs. Morton
and all the members of the cabinet, with
the ladif's of their families, were among
the earliest arrivals. Secretary Elkins
met with the cabinet for thetirst time, and
he and Secretary Foster, who is just out
from a severe illness, were greeted with
special cordiality.
The diplomatic corps turned out in full
force to pay their respects, the members
resplendent in court dress. Senor Romero,
of Mexico, the dean of the corps,
was at the head of the line with
Mme. Romero. They were accompanied
bv seven members of the Mexican lega
tion. Italy was represented by the Mar
quis Impenali di Francavilla, charge d'af
faires ad interim. Pedro Montt, minister;
Mrs. Montt, Senor Anibal Cruza and Senor
Guillormo Arniulagui, of the legation,
were Chile's representatives. Minister
Tsui Kwo Yen and a number of pictur
esquely attired members of the Chinese
legation attracted considerable attention
from those to whom the receptions were
new. Many other countries were also
present, either through their ministers
or other members of the legation. The
costumes of the iadie3 were tine and ele
gant.
The diplomatic corps was invited in a
body to a place behind the line of the re
ceiving party, and spent a quarter of an
hour or longer conversing with the ladies
there. Senators Cullom, Carlisle, Gibson
and Allen, with the members of their
families, were introduced to the receiving
party immediately after the diplomatic
corps. Chief Justice Fuller and all the
members of the supreme court except Jus
tice Bradley were presented. The justices
of the court of claims and of the district su
preme court also paid their respect. At 11
o'clock the congress of the United States
was received. General John Foater.special
representative of the state department,
came next. The American Historical
Society had several members in line. The
army and navy and marine corps was rep
resented by all the officers who were sta
tioned at or near the capital. General
Miles, of Chicago, and General Wheaton,
of Omaha, were the only officers of promi
nence who came from a distance. General
Scliofield was at the head of the army line,
and Commodore liamsay led the naval
contingent. The officers were all in full
dress uniform. The regulars were followed
by General Ordway and staif, of the Na
tional Guard of the District of Columbia.
It was now about 12 o'clock, and the fol
lowing half hour was devoted to the recep
tion of the different federal commissioners
and officers of the executive departments
and the Grand Army of the Republic.
A great crowd of people were in line
waiting to pay their respects and it was
not until nearly 2 o'clock that the recep
tion came to close.
Vice-President and Mrs. Morton re
ceived at their residence from 12 to 2
o'clock. They were assisted by a number
of ladies, and the list of callers included
neariy all the officials who had previously
visited the White House.
In accordance with the usual custom the
secretary of state gave breakfast in honor
of the diplomatic corps immediately alter
they hail paid their respects to the presi
dent. Breakfast was followed by a recep
tion which was largely attended. Large
receptions were held by the ladies anil tiio
families of other members of the cabinet.
Mrs. Crisp, wife of the speaker, and Mrs.
Elkins did not receive.
CHICAr.O GREETS THE NEW TEAR.
A Chinaman Chased I'erhap# to Death
lir Fltp Hundred Hoodlums.
CHICAGO, Jan. I.—Five hundred boys
armed with tin horns attempted to drive a
Chinaman. I.ee Wah, into the lake a little
alter 12 o'clock this morning. The boys
obtained the horns to assist in welcoming
the new year, but, seeing I.ee at State and
Madison streets, one of the merry
makers thrust his horn to his
ear and blew. Lee Wah retaliated
by smashing the horn. The corner
is the most central point in the city, and
seemingly in a twinkling half a thousand
boys with horns gathered and vociferously
crowded near the frenzied A voice
in the crowd shouted: "Kill the heathen;"
another: "Throw him into the lake." Alt
were anxious for excitement, and scarcely
had the latter proposition been made be
fore it was shouted over ami over
by hundreds. The Chinaman started
to run south on Slate, but was
quickly flanked and driven east
on Madison toward the lake. HatJeas and
with tail and robes flying in the wind, the
Chinaman dashed across the >ake front
common, straight toward the piers.
The mob almost had hands on him
within fifty feet of the choppy waves,
when a rapidly-passing suburban train was
boarded by the Celestial. He was seen to
jump off the other side, and either ted into
the water or took refuge in the ia *yrinth
of freight trains near at hand. The dis
appointed mob patrolled the shore for an
hour, Tying with the the tug boat whistles

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, SATURDAY, JANUARY 2, 1892.
JOY OVER FREEDOM.
Colored People Celebrate Their
Emancipation.
PROUD OF THEIR PROGRESS.
Able Speeches By Some of Their Loader*
on tho Blessings of Freedom and
Use Made of It.
The colored people of Seattle celebrated
the anniversary of the emancipation
proclamation by holding an enthusiastic
nieeting last night in the municipal court
room. Several hne speeches were made
by colored men. though Captain W. D.
Mathews, of Leavenworth, Kan., who was
expected to be present to deliver the
speech of the evening, did not arrive, evi
dently having been snow-bound some
where. The meeting was called to order
by William Gross, and J. A. Coleman
acted as master of ceremonies. Rev. L. S.
Blakeney led in prayer.
G. H. Gross was introduced as the first
speaker. He sai l:
"1 am not going to afflict you with a
speech. I am oniy going to attempt to
translate into words a sentiment that
I can see mirrored in all your faces—
rejected, as I am sure, directly from your
hearts. We have assembled here tonight
to celebrate that great freedom and na
tional right that was bestowed upon us
thirty years ago. And we commemorate
it tonight that the rising generations of
our race may imbibe and become more en
lightened regarding the noble acts of hero
ism and patriotism showered upon us by
our friends and brethren in procuring for
us this national legacy.
As a race we owe much to the Federal
Union. It is that Union that we are chietly
indebted to for what makes us most proud
of our home, country and race. Out of
the chaos and ruin of the rebellion arose
this great republic, grand and Symmet
rical. Let us behold the gorgeous ensign
of the republic, now known and honored
throughout the earth, and everywhere
spread over in characters of living light,
blazing on all its ample folds, as they
doat o'er land and sea, proclaiming that
sentiment that is dear to every true Amer
ican heart: "Liberty and Union now
and forever, one and inseparable."
So we readily perceive that in our daily
walks of life, during the past thirty years,
tiie Afro-Americans have proven them
selves loyal citizens to the republic, and,
as Americans, we expect to share equally
the blessings of liberty and ever stand
ready to contend for the rights and liber
ties of mankind. I am proud to see that
our race is realizing the power of their
rising generation and daily promoting
them to such places in their spheres of life
as will afford them the opportunity of
propounding their opinions to the world
and demanding the same rights and privi
leges extended to all other races. All men
hate to grow old. There is a power in
youthful spirit that all men recognize.
St. John affirmed it when in words
of love he said: 'I have written
unto you, young men, because ye
are strong.' Statesmen and philosophers
allirm it when they rest upon it the tefcfety
and liberty of the people. So long as a
nation preserves the spirit of youth, the
government and people are safe. The
Afro-Americans are seemingly impressing
wisdom upon the minds of their youth
that they may be able to gain liberty and
justice for their people without an army
and navy, without a spear or a shield, but
by the mere exercise of their voice. Free
speech is not merely a spark from an elo
quent orator's glowing tongue, even
though his utterance has power to kindle
men's passions or melt their hearts. It is
an oratory of its own and not every orator
is its apostle. Its mission is to rescue from
captivity some divinely inspired truth or
principle that unjust men have locked in
dungeons or bound in chains. For thirty
years the free speech of this country was
consecrated to one sublime idea—an idea
carved on the bell of independence, which
says: "Proclaim liberty throughout the
land to all the inhabitants thereof!" After
thirty years' debate it is like Ophelia's
rosemary—it is for remembrance.
The Afro-Americans had many true
friends, such as Lincoln, Grant, Sumner
and John Brown, who hare by their ardu
ous labors tried to remove that obstacle
that has prevented us from occupying the
many positions we should hold in this re
public. But lonsr enough have we waited,
watched aud trusted. It is time for us to
act. By steady perseverance and sincerity,
with our hearts on our welfare and ad
vancement of our race, and our reliance
upon God, we must advance. Crowned
with ambition, the glory of our brow is
justice, the splendor of our eye is liberty,
and our bosom of patriotism and chivalry
shall nourish endless generations.
While other nations are casting off the
chains of despotism, while our Creator is
drawing the oppressors of the earth down
to the rocks, what is to be the position,
what is to be the watchword, of the Afro-
Americans ? Every day new questions are
brought before us. Now it is one, again
another. Sometimes it is morality, some
times our deficiency in industry and vigor,
and then again that great shadow looming
above the horizon, the color line. Who
shall take them and tear them open and
let the light shine through them. It is
the work of the Afro-Americans to prove
to the inhabitants of the world that
the people do actually govern and
that what eight millions of freemen
determined shall be di ne. Popular com
motion and partisan fury may dash their
mad waves against us, but they shall roll
back. Persecution shall not shnke us nor
fanaticism disturb us. but we shall stnnd
towering, sublime, majestic, immutable
and magnificent. Despair not. then,
soldier, countryman and friend. We shall
yet dwell together in harmony, and but
one nation shall inhabit this great repub
lic. I iberty and union shall spread a
civilization from Occident to Orient, and
from the tlowery shores of the great south
ern gulf to the frozen barriers of the
Arctic—not intertwined with slavery, but
purged of its contaminating influence—a
Civilization that means universal freedom,
universal enfranchisement and universal
brotherhood.
The speech was loudly applauded.
A. A. Garner was then called for, and
responded as follows:
'•1 have not been expecting to be called
upon tonight, but ttiat is no ev;Jence that
I am not interested in the question which
has called us together. Knowing things
as I do and having studied the history of
the American negro as I have. I would
consider myself disloyal to refuse to say
something on an occasiou like this. Ido
not know whether it was the intention
of Abraham Lincoln to free the negro
previous to the day he issued the
proclamation, but things rounded up so
there was no alternative. One hundred
davs previous he announced a conditional
proclamation, and told the rebels that un
less they ceased hostilities he would set
the negroes free. I have never been struck
by a rebel's whip, but my poor parents
have U-en. and for this reason my mind
reverts to the da\s ot slavery with more
feeling."
C. A. llideout was the next speaker. He
said, in part:
-I can account for my interest in the
colored people wliea 1 remeaiber that one
of them was my nurse and my dearest
friend. I grew up in a family of colored
people and know something of their hab
its. customs, hopes and fears, and can
Bpeak of them in their domestic and social
life.
"The colored people pay taxes now on
1111.000.000 worth of property in nine
Southern states, and upward of $263,000,-
000 worth in the whole United States —
besides owning enough church and
school property to swell the to
tal to $500,000,000. I tell you,
my friends, lam glad lam a negro. lam
glad I belong to a race which can come up
through the crust and show other civilized
races we are their equals. If the negro
has not made himself felt politically, he is
placing himself in a position to do so,
They have said our women were not
equal in chastity with those of the other
races. I can say as regards the negroes in
this city that in all the homes I have vis
ited they have not a superior among
the whites as to culture and re
finement. Every race must have
ambition, and it must originate around
the lire altar. It has been said we were
inferior, and never calculated to be the
peer of the whites. Some of our race are
ashamed they are negroes; they would
prefer to be a Chinaman or an Indian.
You never heard of an Indian or a China
man l>eing able to plead his cause before a
congress of the United States. But thous
ands of negroes have ability to do so. and
many of them have done so. Every
battle the negroes took part in
during the war was successful. The
negroes dug the canal for Ben Butler. But
with all this some of us are ashamed of
the race. Why? Some negroes quarrel
about religion. Religion should not di
vide us. We are all going to heaven, any
how."
At the conclusion of the meeting those
present adjourned to the hall at the corner
of Seventh and Cherry streets and enjoyed
themselves dancing.
On January 12 the hall of the lodge of
colored Masons will be dedicated, and in
the evening a public installation of officers
of the lodge wiil take place. Captain W.
D. Matthews, of Leavenworth, Kan., will
be present as the speaker of the occasion.
RUNAWAY CAUSES EXCITEMENT.
A Horse Races s Fire Engine and
Smashes His Cart to Fragments.
A few minutes after 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon a gray horse attached to a two
wheeled cart took fright on Pike street
and ran away, endangering the lives of
several pedestrians and creating much ex
citement.
The cart, which was driven by a young
man whose name could not be learned,
came down Front street and had just
turned into Pike street when the tire bell
sounded the alarm from box 42, caused by
a small blaze in a room at the Northwest
ern hotel. The noise of fire engine No. 2
just leaving the Pine street engine-house
frightened the horse, and he sprang for
ward, dumping the driver out into the
mud, and started up the street like a
cyclone. The animal made a bee-line
for J. W. Hobensack's drug store at the
southwest corner of Pike and Second
streets, but he missed going through the
glass front by slipping and falling on the
stone pavement. The momentum caused
the horse to slide on his side to Second
street, where he rolled in the gutter. He
sprang to his feet and again started off
down Second street, wrenching ofl one of
the wheels of the vehicle against a tele
graph pole. A lady coming out of the
drug store narrowly escaped death under
the frightened animal's feet.
Just as the horse regained his feet and
started down Second, engine No. 2 turned
the corner of Pike street into Second.
Then began an exciting race. The run
away took the lead and continued straight
ahead, scattering in all directions the
pedestrians who thronged the street.
At the corner of Second and Seneca
streets was a saddle horse hitched to a
post, and the animal jumped and tugged
at his halter to get away. He fell down
just as the runaway horse and cart
brushed past him. It was thought by
many that the animal was knocked down.
The gray horse continued his mad ca
reer down Second street to Yesler avenue,
then turned into South Third street,
scattering pieces of the demolished cart
all along the line. At the corner of Third
and Jackson streets the animal was cap
tured and led back up town by the driver,
who had followed all the way on the run.
No one was hurt, and the horse was none
the worse for his exciting run, with the
exception that he was so nearly exhausted
he could hardly walk.
NEW BAPTIST TASTOR ARRIVES.
Rev. M. 1.. Rugf to Take Charge of the
North Seattle Chorch.
Rev. M. L. Rugg, who has accepted a
call to the pastorate of the North Seattle
liaptist church, arrived in the city from
Victoria yesterday and is at the Snoqual
inie. lie will preach his first sermon in
his new church, at Third and Cedar
streets, at 11 o' clock tomorrow morning.
Mr. Rugg is a native of Vermont, and
graduated at the Colgate, formerly Madi
son, university, New York, and at
Hamilton Theological seminary. His
lirst pastorate was in New York
state, lasting four years, and was very
successful, the church being one of the
largest and most flourishing in the state
when he left it. He then came out to
Salem, Or., where he found the church
very weak and deeply in debt. After a
year's work he had doubled the member
ship of the church and greatly increased
its financial strength. He then went to
Victoria as pastor of the Calvary Raptist
church, where he has been for four years.
While there he has sent out a large colony
end nevertheless more than doubled the
strength of his own congregation and
made several additions to the church
building.
On the occasion of his leaving Victoria,
Mr. Rupg was on Tuesday evening pre
sented with a check for $113.75 by his con
gregation, and with a beautiful gold
headed cane by a number of friends out
side tho church, while Mrs. Rugg was
sented with a silver tea set. The farewell
reception was participated in by all the
Baptist churches and was very generally
attended by other citizens.
Mr. Rugg has been hiphly appreciated
and extremely successful wherever he has
been pastor.
WOMEN AT HOTELS.
Generally S|>e»kinsr They Art Better
Customers INan Men.
Ferdinand Schmita, one of the proprie
tors of the Arlington hotel and also the
Snoqualmie, said last night: "Some peo
ple have an idea thai women are very fussy
and nit very desirable guests at a hotel;
but this impression is far from correct.
Vnlessaman is a very liberal patron of
the l>ar, I should prefer for an equal sum
of money to rent a room to a woman. Of
course, she wauts thinps neat, perhaps a
little neater than a man would, but in a
first-class hotel she will have no cause for
complaint on this score, and she is not
likely to demand anything unreasonable.
"It is cheaper to feed t;ie average woman
than the average man. She asks for her
soup, fish, one kind of meat and a little
pastry for dessert, and with that she is
generally satisfied. But a man must try
everything on the bill ot fare—oysters, all
sorts of entrees, three or four varieties of
roasted and boiled meats, two or three
salads, and all the dessert there is; and
what he doesn't eat, of coarse, he spoils.

THE OLD LANDMARK.
TLog Cabin at Al-KI Point Will Soon Be
a Thing of the Fast.
The old log cabin on Al-Ki point,
erected by Arthur A. Denny in the winter
of 1801-52 at the time of the lirst settle
ment there, is still standing somewhat
dilapidated. Mr. Denny said a few days
ago that he thought the present season
would be the last one for this historical
landmark. Some time ago he tried to buy
the land on which the cabin stands, in
order that the building might be repaired
and preserved in its original form; but the
owners of the property declined to sell,
because they were contemplating some
improvements in the way of a wharf and
warehouses. These improvements will
crowd the cabin out, and so repairs will
be useless.
COUNT* TAX PAYMENTS.
Lirg* Collections tn Pate—Warrants to
Be Called in.
To date the county treasurer has col
lected in taxes $294,380.53. In addition to
this amount he has in hand about $35,000
in unsettled accounts, which are subject,
however, to radical changes and correc
tions. Taxes become delinquent after
March 1, but, if taxpayers continue paying
at the rate they h*ve during the past three
weeks, there will be no need to issue
notices of delinquency.
On January 4 the treasurer will issue a
call for the payment of county road, bridge
and school warrants.
At the Hospital*.
Mrs. Channelle, a nurse, was sent to
Grace hospital yesterday suffering with
the grip. l\ Christianson was also ad
mitted at the same hospital sulFering from
the same malady. Fred Johnson was
admitted to be treated for typhoid fever.
Peter Peterson, who was injured on an
electric railroad in North Seattle, was dis
charged, having been in the hospital
about six months. J. Hancock was also
discharged.
A Thankful I'astor'* Wife.
I desire to take this public manner of
expressing my thanks to the very kind
members and friends of Grace Methodist
Episcopal church who contributed toward
making up the purse which was presented
to me on Christmas eve. Such a present
would have been appreciated at any time,
but it was doubly so coming at the time
and under the circumstauces which it
did. MKS. A. A. MCMIU.IV.
