# Chronicling America Improvements

This update enhances the Chronicling America functionality in the Nova application with improved date filtering and a more user-friendly interface.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Improved Date Filtering

- Fixed the date filtering to properly search by month and day, not just year
- Implemented a robust API client that uses the same date format as the web UI (MM/DD/YYYY)
- Added multiple search strategies that try different approaches for the best results
- Improved pagination support to retrieve more search results

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

- Reordered search fields with State selection at the top
- Added dynamic newspaper loading based on state selection
- Improved newspaper dropdown display with detailed information:
  - Publication title
  - LCCN code
  - Location (city, state)
  - Available date range
- Added custom LCCN search functionality with checkbox toggle
- Updated default download settings to prioritize JP2 format

### 3. Better User Experience

- Newspapers are sorted alphabetically, ignoring leading "The" for better organization
- State selection supports keyboard navigation (typing first letter jumps to matching state)
- Improved status messages that provide more detail about the search process
- Added more detailed information in the newspaper dropdown to help users identify relevant publications

## Testing and Verification

### Test Scripts

1. **test_improved_ca_client.py**: Tests the improved API client with various search strategies
2. **test_newspaper_by_state_direct.py**: Tests fetching newspaper listings by state
3. **test_improved_ca_tab.py**: Provides a standalone test window for the improved interface

### Update Script

Use the `update_ca_tab.py` script to replace the original tab with the improved version:

```
python3 src/update_ca_tab.py
```

This script creates a backup of the original file before replacing it.

## Implementation Details

### API Client Improvements

The improved API client now uses multiple search strategies:

1. **Web UI Format Strategy**: Uses the MM/DD/YYYY format with specific parameters (dateFilterType=range, searchType=advanced) to match the web UI's search capability, providing the most accurate results.

2. **Direct URL Construction**: For specific cases, directly constructs URLs for each date in the range to find specific issues.

3. **Year + Month Text Strategy**: Searches by year and includes the month name as a keyword.

4. **Year-Only Strategy**: Fallback strategy that searches by year only.

### UI Improvements

The improved UI provides a more user-friendly experience:

1. **State Selection**: Select a state to automatically load all available newspapers from that state.

2. **Newspaper Selection**: Dropdown shows detailed information about each newspaper, including location and date range.

3. **Custom LCCN Option**: Toggle checkbox to enable manual LCCN entry and search.

4. **Date Range Selection**: Clearly separated and positioned below the newspaper selection.

5. **Keyword Search**: Kept but moved to the bottom as it's less frequently used due to OCR quality issues.

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements could include:

1. Worker threads for loading newspaper data to improve responsiveness
2. Caching of newspaper metadata to speed up repeated searches
3. More detailed newspaper information display with thumbnails
4. Batch downloading of multiple date ranges
