SULLIVAN AT HIS OLD GAMES.

His Creatures Still Hounding Cohoon—
Persecuting Railroad Men,

Tacoma, Oct. 14.—[Special.}—John L. Cohoon,
brother-in-law of Edward Albertson, who was
kidnaped by Detective Sullivan on suspicion of
having kuowledge concerning the Fidelity
Trust Company bank robbery, was surprised
last night by the appearance at his home of De-
tective Scott, alias Williams. It will be remem-
bered that Williams was placed in the county
jail under the guise of adefaulter. He was put
into a cell with Cohoon and tried to pump him,
but did not succeed. Since being “released”
Scott has visited Portland, and last night asked
Cohoon if he did not want to take a walk. Co-
hoon declined, saying he never went out of
doors at night.

Cohoon’s friends do not understand Sullivan's
game, but think he is trying to find out when
and how Cohoon is going ‘to bring action for
damages against Sullivan and the bank for un-
lawful detention and imprisonment. Cohoon
was kept in a room for several days at the Fife
hotel.

R. B. Albertson will probably be arraigned
Monday on the charge of complicity in the Fi-
delity bank robbery. Hewever, no definite in-
formation as to the day of arraignment can be
had,

It is stated tonight on good authority that
Sullivan has succeeded in having every North-
ern Pacific railroad man who was in the vicin-
ity of Tenth street and Pacific avenue the night
he was knocked down and kicked by an un-
known map, laid off. This was done, it is said,
on the theory that they were interested in see-
ing Sullivan whipped. [tis more than proba-
ble that those who say they know who slugged
Sullivan, tell the whole truth.
