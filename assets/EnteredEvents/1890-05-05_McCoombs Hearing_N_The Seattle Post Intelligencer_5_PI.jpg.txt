He Will Answer to the Charge of Forgery Today

Ex-secretary J.P. McCoombs, of the relief committee, will be given a preliminary hearing by Justice Miler at 10 o'clock this morning upon the charge of uttering a forged check preferred on Thrusday by George H. Heilbron, of the relief committee.  Prosecuting Atoorney Carr will be absent from the city today, and Assistant Prosecuting Attorney May will conduct the prosecution.  R.B. Albertson and George Donworth will defend McCoombs.  

the charge of uttering a forged checck against McCoombs, an act contrary to section 854 of the penal code, which provides for imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than fourteen years, and a fine not exceeding $5,000 in case of conviction, is based upon the following facts.  Among the thirteen cases investigated by Officer Barck was one of Mrs. Maroney, a deserving widow living at Fourteenth street and Yesler avenue.  Her neighbors applied for relief for her, and a check for $20 with which to buy provisions for her was drawn.  Mrs. Maroney recieved part of the groceries but never saw the check, although McCoombs cashed it at the Puget Sound National bank on the strength of her endorsement.  The case was worked up by Detective Rogers, who claims that he can make out a clear case against McCoombs. 

The auditors having in charge the examination of the accounts of the relief committee and of ex-secretary McCoombs, will have a partial report ready this morning.  The contents are unknown.
