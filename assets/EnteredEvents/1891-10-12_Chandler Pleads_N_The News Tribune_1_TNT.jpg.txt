Fred N. Chandler, the accomplice o'
Edward Albertson in the robbery of th«
Fidelity Trust Company, was brough
into court this morning by the sherif
and was arraigned. by Judge Johr
Beverly on a charge of grand larceny.

Chandler listened to the reading o
the information without a single evi
dence of uneasiness, and when it wa:
concluded, replied to the judge’s inquiry
as to whether he was __ read)
to plead that he was and to the questior
if he was guilty or not guilty replied.
*‘Guilty, your honor,” with a smile anc
without betraying the least symptom o!
anxiety or uneasiness. Chandler looks
none the worse for his incarceration. In
fact he is not one whom any discrim
inating person would pick out for 2
criminal and so Judge Beverly remark
ed, ‘‘There is not one bad feature in his
face.’’

These facts probably gave rise to the
rumor which was current on the streets
this morning to the effect that Chandle
had made a confession implicating R. B.
Albertson, of Seattle, but inquiry 0!
Sheriff Price and of President Wallace
of the Trust Company brought out 2
prompt denial of the rumor.

A letter from Gardiner announces that
Albertson is recovering and has been
able to walk around a little for the last
few days.
