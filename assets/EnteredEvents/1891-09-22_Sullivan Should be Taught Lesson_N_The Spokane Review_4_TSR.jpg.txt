Should Teach Him a Lesson.

East Washingtonian: It turns out
that Detective Sullivan, who kidnaped
Rh. B. A\bertson on the streets of Seattle
last week, is the same fellow who estab-
lished a dead line at the Black Diamond
coal mines last April, over, which
neither a white nor negro was allowed to
pass under penalty of being shot. The
people of this state have seen enough of
these rufflan detectives who openly defy
our laws, and now that they have got
hold of this fellow they should teach
him sach a lesson as wiil cause him to
think twice before practicing his lawless
methods in the state of Washington
