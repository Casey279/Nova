MARRIED IN COURT.

A Young Seattle Girl Wedded to Her Father's Murderer.

SEATTLE, June 20.â€”The closing act of the tragedy which resulted in the trial of Paul Stark for the murder of Nels Bloomstran, took place before Judge Litchenberg yesterday, when Stark and Chestie Bloomstran were married.

Mrs. Bloomstran did not consent to the marriage, but Chestie, being of age, had the right to appoint a guardian and named Deputy Sheriff Manson, who consented.

Judge Humes was asked to perform the ceremony and gave as his reason for declining: "Old Nels Bloomstran was that girl's guardian by the laws of God and man. He was opposed to this marriage and because he would not give his consent he died and went to meet his God. He would not consent and I will not sanction or give my consent to it. Knowing all the facts in the case as I do, I cannot conscientiously do it and I will not."
