THE ALBERTSON CASE.

What the San Francisco Examiner Has to
Say on the Subject.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15.—The Ex
aminer prints a statement regarding
the Fidelity Trust bank at Tacoma by
secretary Albertson, on August 24 last,
that while it was heretofore believed
that Albertson had lost the sum of
$8,000 in speculation, it now appears
that he took with him when he left
$20,000 in cash and nearly a million in
securities,

Early on the morning of August 24
Paul Schulze, a director of the bank,
received a notefrom Albertson saying
he had lost $10,000 of the bank’s
money in speculation, and to force a
compromise had taken $10,000 more
cash and had 800,000 in securities,
Moreover, he had changed the com-
bination of the vaults and it would take
three days to open them, Meanwhile
the banks credit would sufler, De
would meethim (Schulze) or any one
representative of the bank ata desig-
nated place and return the securities if
given a written agree not to prosecute.

The point chosen gave 4 command-
ing view of all approaches, and Albert-
son said he would flee at once if he saw
more than one man coming to the
rendezvous.

A meeting of the directors was held
and it was agreed to accept a compro-
mise.

A man was sent to the rendezvous
and signed an agreement not to prose-
cute,

Instead of Albertsnn he found a
Tacoma gambler, one Chandler, who)
was evidently an accomplice. The
messenger gave him the agreement
and received the securities and the
combination of the vaults,

The men separated and the messen-
ger saw Albertson join Chandler.

The bank at once commenced an ex-
traordinary effort to capture the thieves

J. H, Cahoon, cashier of the bank,
and afbrother-in-law of Albertson, was
arrested by Detective Sullivan, who
kept him confined several days trying
to force a confession. Ihe story got
out and Sullivan was forced to release
the prisoner, who was then legally ar-
rested for complicity.

Last Thursday Sullivan and two
guards boldly kidnapped R. B. Albert-
son on the streets of Seattle, |

The kidnappers were followed,’ ar-
rested, and the prisoner released.

Albertson was suspected of com.
plicity in his cousin’s actions. It is
believed the thieves have escaped.
