WHIPPED BY A MAORI.

A Juggier Gets a Terrible Beating at the
Hands of Agnes Woodward.

Kalkasa, who, according to the Standard
theater posters, is the “greatest juggler
living,” was severely cowhided at tne cor-
ner of South Second and Washington
streets at 8 o’clock last evening by Agnes
Woodward, a notorious Maori woman.

Kaikasa is playing quite alengthy en-
gagement at the Standard theater and has
been in the city for sometime. He met
Agnes: Woodward shortly after arriving
here, but after ashort acquaintance the
two fell out. Then, itis claimed, be un-
gallantly used language uncompii-
mentary to his whilom friend. This
reached her ears and she ‘resolyed to
revenge herself for the insult. Yesterday
afternoon she purchased a pretty lite cow-
hide riding whip and 8 o'clock last e
found her in waiting for ber victim near
the . He came along presently and
when passed near where the Maori
stood, she sprang forward and brought
the whip down across his face with
terrible force, Again and again she raised
the whip and brought it down across the
head and shoulders of Kalkasa, uttering a
malediction at each blow. Kalkasa
stunned at first and then blinded by the
blows, was unable to do anything to defend
himself. The pain he suffered was in-
tense, each leash neariy bringin g blood.
He endeavored to seize the whip but could
not, and finally broke and ran up Wash-
ington street, thus only escaping the infu-
riated woman. The woman did not follow,
bat quietly walked into Kerkow’s drug
store and threw down her whip. By this
time quite a crowd had collected, and this
annoyed her so that she called a hack and
was driven home, :

Agnes Woodward is the woman who was
charged about a year anda half aco with
the murder of Frank Cunningham, a hacke
man,in Portiand, She was acquitted of the
charge, but many stiil insist that she was
guilty of the crime.

Kaikasa’s injuries are very severe, and
he threatens to have his assailant arres‘ed
this morning.
