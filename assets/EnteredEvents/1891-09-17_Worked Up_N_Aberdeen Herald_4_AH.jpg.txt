Tacoma and Seattle have been very
much worked up over the arrest of R. B.
Albertson, of Seattle, by a Pierce county
deputy under the espionage of Private
Detective M.C. Sullivan. There would
have been no reason to take exception
to the arrest had the private detective
element been left out. With this element
thrown in, the arrest was an outrage
upon the man arrested and upon every
man in the state of Washington. Either
the law-makers of the state of Washing-
ton must make the laws of the state a
sufficient protection to life, liberty and
property, or we must acknowledge the
insufficiency of the law, and let private
detectives and mob rule take its place.
