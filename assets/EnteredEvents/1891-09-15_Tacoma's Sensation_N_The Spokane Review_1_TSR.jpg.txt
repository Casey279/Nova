Tacoma, Sept. 14.—[Special.]—
When the case of R. B. Albertson
was called in Justice Sharp’s court
this afternoon the courtroom was
filled to overflowing by an anxious
crowd attracted by the annoince-
ment that sensational developments
would come out at the hear-
ing. R. B, Albertson is the
Seattle attorney accused of con-
cealing stolen property in
connection with the Fidelity bank
robbery, he being a cousin of Kd-
ward Albertson, the defaulter, who
has not yet been caught. Before
the hearing commenced the original
complaint against R. B. Albertsen
was dismissed and one of grand
jarceny substituted. The hearing
jasted all the afterneon and will be
continued to-morrow,

President Wallace, of the Fidel-
ity company, told how he received
a letter from the defaulting secre-
tary, promising to return the
bonds and_ securities to the
amount of about $900,000
if an agreement were signed to let
him and his accomplice go free. He
gave the letter in question to the
court, told how he wentto the ren-
dezvous and received the papers
from one Chandlerand his subse-
quent actions on returning home,

SAN FRANciIsco, Sept. 13.—The
Examiner prints a statement re-
garding the Fidelity Trust bank at
Tacoma by Secretary Albertson
August 24 last, that while it was
heretefore believed that Albertson
lost the sum of $8,000 in speculation
it now appeare that he took with
him when he left $20,000 in cash
and nearly a million in securities,

Early on the morning of August
24 President Wallace, of the
bank, received a note from Albert-
son saying he had lost $10,000 of the
bank’s money in speculation, and to
force a compromise had taken $10,-
000 more cash and $900,000 in securi-
ties, Moreover, he had changed the
combination of the vaults and it
would take three days to open
them. Meanwhile the bank’s
credit would suffer. He would
meet him (Wallace) or any one repre-
sentative of the bank ata designated
place and return the securities If
given awritten agreement not to
prosecute. The point chosen gave
& commanding view of all ap-
proaches, and Albertson said he
would flee atonceif he saw more
than one man coming to the ren-
dezvoua,

A meeting of the directors was
held and it was agreed to accept the
compromise, A man was sent to
the rendezvous with a signed agree-
ment not to prosecute. Instead of
Albertson he found a Tacoma gam-
bler, one Chandler, who was evi-
dently an accomplice. The messen-
ger gave him the agreement and
received the securities and the
combination to the vaults. The
men separated and the messenger
saw Albertson join Chandler.

The bank at once commenced
extraordinary efforts to capture the
thieves. J. H. Cahoon, cashier of
the bank and brother-in-law of
Albertson, was arrested by Detective
Sullivan, who kept him confined
several days trying te force a con-
fession. The story got out and
Sullivan was forced to release his
prisoner, who then was legally
arrested for complicity. Last
Thuraday Sullivan and two guards
bodly kidnaped RB. Albertson,
second cousin of the absconder, and
W. F. Bailey, who happened to be
with him on the streets of Seattle.
The kidnapers were followed, ar-
rested and the prisoners released.
Albertson was suspected of com-

licity in his cousin’s actions. It
8 believed the thieves have escaped.
