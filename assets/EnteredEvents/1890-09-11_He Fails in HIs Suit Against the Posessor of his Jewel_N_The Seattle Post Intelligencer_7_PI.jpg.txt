He Fails in His Suit Against the Pos-
sessor of His Jewel. :

George Kidd, a dapper, flippant young
man of smooth address and fashionable
attire, who has several times heretofore
figured in the courts for having in his pos-
session a diamond pin alleged to have been
stolen from William Nickum, was awarded
the ownership of the pin by Justice Miller
last evening.

When the case was calied the defendant
came into court with his lover—‘‘Miss’’
Agnes Woodward—and two other women.
Heclaimed that the woman was @ very
dear friend of his, and that on August 24
last she gave “her George” the pin as a
birthday present. The woman took
the stand and produced a_ writ-
ten receipt showing that she pur-
chased the pin from Nickum
for $65. ones Policeman Caldwell, who
has the Whitechape! beat, also acknowl-
edged that he acted as detective for the
woman who was suspected of a crime, and
for twa weeks had in his possession the re-
ceipt, which was alleged to be a forgery,
trying to make outastrong case for the
suspect, and also otherwise intérested him-
self in behalf of the defendant.

Nickum, who at one time figured in a
scrape and also bears an unsavory
reputation, said he was beastiy drunk at
the time he lost the pin, but never sold it,
aud that he believed Agnes Woodward
stole itfrom him. The justice settied the
case by giving the pin back to the de-
fendant.
