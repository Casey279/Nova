THE ALBERTSON CASE.

‘It is inconceivable that the parties who
- @fe urging the prosecution at Tacoma of
“Mr. BR. B. Albertson of this city on a
_ charge of larceny, deem him really guilty.
- It is too monstrously improbable and ab-
gurd for serious belief. They found them-
elves yesterday morning when the case
‘came for trial in aposition where they were
totally unable to maintain the original
- eharge of complicity in the robbery of the
 Widelity bank, and the later charge of
larceny was simply ttumped up to pro-
long the nasty business of prose-
” ution and to avoid the
_ acknowledgment which immediate dis-
"= wrinsal would have implied. Nobody
knows betier than the promoters and—
Managers of this prosecution that Mr.
Aibertson had no part in the concep-
tion or the execution of the crim-
imal act, and to share in the spoils
of that transaction. There will, of course,
be a pretense of atrial, and the thug Sul-
_ livan will providea sufficient amount of
_ perjured evidence to give the more re-
spectable parties in the affair a chance to
crawl out with a pretence of fair conduct.
This sort of thing is, of couse, the regular
ee Thug Sullivan, and itis not

that he should be en-
gaged in ft ian it would be to find him
doing any. other dirty and dis.
reputable act. The only  surpris-
thing is that a man like
Mr. T. B. Wallace should be found in com-
pany and in practical partnership with
him in the low business of falsely accusing
and infamously prosecuting a citizen who
fs absolutely free from criminality and
_ whose innocence calls for no proof.
