chestie Bloomstran’s Lover Testifies.

- Special to the Ledger.

SraTtLeE, May 20.—Tayler Starks, the
defendant in the murder case on trial
here, testified to-day and told how and

why he killed Nels Bloomstran. He and
his sweetheart, Chestie Bloomstran,
were hastily leaving her father’s house
when they saw Bloomstran coming with
a pistol in hand. When he got too close
Starks stopped and told him to hold on
and not bea fool. Bloomstran stopped
and immediately fired, cursing and say-
ing he would kill them both. He
fired the second time beiore Starks fired.
He says he shot low, for he did not want
to kill Bloomstran, but he had to shoot
to save his own life. He did not know
whether he had hit Bloomstran, but
went on to Fallcuy and Bloomstran
turned and ran back toward his house.
The next day he heard that Bloomstran
was dead, and he went off to collect some
money to stand trial. Two days later
he returned and gave himself up. Sev-
eral witnesses were called to prove the
violent temper of Bloomstran and his
threats that he would kiil Taylor Starks
before he should marry his daughter.
Starks’ testimony was not finished when
court adjourned.
