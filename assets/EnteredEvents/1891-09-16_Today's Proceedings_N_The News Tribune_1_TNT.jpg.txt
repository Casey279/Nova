TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS.

Interest in the examination of R. B.
Albertson has not by any means abated,
the court room, this morning, was
crowded as heretofore by the curious,
court being held at the Municipal court
room. The only evidence approximat-
ing a sensation was the reading of the
biank agreement dictated by R. B, Al-
bertson from the notes of the sten-
ographer, Mr, Walter A. Kean.

George Hyde Preston, at the opening
of the session, was recalled to the stand
to explain the method of bookkeeping
of the firm of Preston, Albertson & Don-
worth. Hestated that it was the usual
double-eniry method.

Seattle since 1888, and am a member of
the firm of Preston, Albertson & Don-
wo th; during June a man named Ross
came to onr office, about a month beiore
I went to the East with my wife on
July 23d; Mr. Albertson came to me
and told me that Ross had ealled and
held himself to be a representative of a
friend of R. B. Albertson.” He then
