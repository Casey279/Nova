CHANDLER PLEADS GUILTY.

Edward Albertson’s Confederate Con-
fesses With a Smile on His Face.

Tacoma, Oct, 12.—Fred N. Chandler, accom-
plice of Edward Albertson in the Fidelty Trust
Company bank robbery, today pleaded guilty to
grand larceny before Superior Court Judge
Beverly. When arraigned Chandler was very
composed, and listened with manifest interest
to the reading of the information. He told the
court complacently that he was ready to plead,
after the information had been read, and when
asked how he would plead he responded
promptly and with a genial smile:

“Guilty, your honor!”

Judge Beverly thought Chandler’s face devoid
ot bad features, and others present in court
remarked thatthe young man would passina
érowd for a bank clerk or a person of more than
the average degree of culture and refinement.

Sheriff Price denies the rumor, current this
morning, that Chandler made a confession
implicating R. B. Albertson, of Seattle. Presi-
dent Wallace of the bank also denies the rumor.
R. B. Alberison’s friends in this city breathe
more freely now that Chandler has been ar-
raigned without any attempt to incriminate Mr.
Albertson of Seattle.

Edward Albertson is expected here this week.
He is able to walk about his room. In bringing
him here the officers will stop overevery night
so as not to fatigue him.
