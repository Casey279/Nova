SEATTLE KIDNAPERS.

BRUTAL DETECTIVES UP FOR
A HEARING.

PUBLIC INDIGNATION INTENSE

Immense Crowds Block the Doors
and Windows of the Court-
room.

SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 11.—[Spe-
cial.J—M. ©, Sullivan, the detec-
tive, and his assistants, Mackay
and Isaac Evans, were brought for
ri hearing before Justice Von Tobel
(to-day, Suilivan to auswer the
charge of assault with a deadly
weapon and the other two on a
simple charge of assault and bat-
tery on R. B, Albertson and W. E.
Bailey, the lawyer and millionaire,
whem they forcibly abducted yes-
terday. The hearing was delayed
somewhat to await the arrival of
Sheriff Price and Prosecuting
Attorney Snell, of Pierce county.
The defendants demanded a jury
trialand a jury was struck. The
hearing was then adjourned until
Tuesday afternoon, after a fight for
delay om the part of defendants’
counsel who fear the effect of pub-
lic indignation on their fate.

An immense crowd witnessed the
hearing, blocking the doors, win-
dows and adjoining streets and
alleys, ‘The charges which have so
far oe entered were only intended
to hold the prisoners while more se-
rious charges are being prepared in
connection with the abduction,

It appears that the kidnapers only
wanted Albertson, and that Evans
had a warrant from Justice Sharp,
of Pierce county, which he served
as a Fierce county yer deta It
charged him with receiving and
concealing, or aiding in the conceal-
ment of $9,000 of notes and other
valuable securities, stolen from the
Fidelity Trust Company, of Tacoma,
by his cousia Edward Albertson.

Sullivan, in a closed carriage with
MokKay and Evans, met Albertson
and Batley on Third street as they
were going to dinner at the Rainier
Club and Evans served the warrant.
Albertson denied its validity, as it
was not indorsed by the sheriff of
King county, and a row followed,
Sullivan and McKay trying to force
Albertson into the hack. At
Bailey’s suggestion they agreed to
goto Albertson’s office, and they
‘all got.in, Bailey included. The
hack drove past the prisener’s office
and on soathward out of the city to
Black River Junction, where the
prisoners were rescued and their
captors captured,

Albertson and a party of friends
went to Tacomathis morning and
the former voluntarily surrendered
himself to Justice Sharp. The jus-
tice fixed a hearing for Monday and
offered torelease Albertson on his
own recognizance, but the latter
insisted on being feo under bonds.
Accordingly the bonds were fixed
at $5,000 and Governor Ferry, Mr
Bailey, Herman Chapin, president |
of the Boston National bank of
Seattle, and W. P. Masterson, pres-
ident of the Patific National bank
of Tacoma, went on his bond, repre-
senting an aggregate of property of
over @ million dollars,

The arrest of Albertson in King
county by a Pierce couuty officer
raises a nice pointof law, on which
lawyers differ, whether an officer of
one county can serve a warrant in
any other county without having it
indorsed by the sheriif or a justice
of that county.
