NEARLY A MILLION
— ‘

R. B, Albertson's Trial Has
Begun.

———--

A VERY NERVY LETTER.

Tbe Story of Albertson’s Embezzlement
is Brought’ Out in Court
At Last.

The story of the Fidelity Bank rob-
bery has never been fully told. A day
orto since an enterprising newspaper
man secured a part of the detals of the
robbery and wired them to the San
francisco Examiner, which sent them
over the country last night by the asso-
tiated press. The Examiner’s details
are only partially correct, so the News
herewith presents the facts in the case
ag they occurred.

Wben Albertson, the embezzling sec-
retary of the Fidelity Trust Company,
left the bank on Saturday night, August
»1 he was an embhezzler to the extent
of $20,000 in cash and $900,000 in securi-
ties of various kinds.

Despite this broad statement of the
robbery, which was one of the most
hold and daring ever perpetrated by
human mind and hands, the bank is
ioday the. loser to the extent of only
31000.

The story of how nearly a million in
securities were returned is both remark-
ible and highly interesting and fully
lemonstrates that oiten truth is stranger
than fiction,

Early in the morning of Sunday,
August 23d, @ director of the Fidelity
< was awakened and handed a note.
ts contents electrified and astonished
iim. It was from Albertson, and told
the story of his crime; how -he had
speculated and lost; how he had _previiously
taken $11,000, covering up the
theft by false entries; how he had
now taken $9000 more, “just’ to
nake it an even. $20,000,” and
now, for a certain purpose, 
had also taken $900,000 in ‘securities.

Albertson’s note aiso presented a plan
it compromise, but the details are to be
ound in the letter itself, forming a part
vu the evidence presented below.

THE CASE IN COURT. ~

On the call to order in court this after-
oon Albertson, accompanied by Don-
vorth and Preston and Judge Burke,
\. C. Bowman, stenographer, W. E.
Bailey and Herman Chapin. | Deputy
‘heriff John B. Croake served a war-
‘ant upon Albertson, reading as follows:
hat on the 23d day of August in said
county R. B. Albertson committed the
time of grand larceny as follows: The
aid R. B. Albertson then and there
ertain gold coins of the current
uoney of the United States of America,
nk notes, certificates of stock and val-
vible seenrities of the value of then and
lieve of $600,000 lawful money of the

nited States of America, the personal
sroperty then and there of the Fidelity
trust company, a corporation then and
here organized and existing under and
y virtue of the laws of the State of
Vashington, feloniously did take, steal
ind carry away.”

The above warrant was based upon a
owplaint this morning filed by T. B.
Vallace in Justice Sharp’s court.

_A delay of half a2 hour was occa-
‘joned by the failure of the stenographer
or the State to arrive on time. |

The courtroom was crowded as it had

lever been crowded before; the crowd

ity Sheriff Ike Evans on ‘the warrant.

The amount of securities taken from

$900,090, which includes all the com-
pany’s notes, collateral and- Land Com-
any contracts. In addition to this I
ave changed all the combinations,
after locking up all the bank books in

If you will sign the three papers—
triplicate—herewith iu the presence of
| two witnesses, have same duly acknow-
ledged and deliver all three to Fred N.
Chandler at Brown’s point on or before
9 o’clock Monday morning (see direc-
j tions below how to meet him), he will
| deliver to you all the above securi-
; ties, ete., valued ‘at $900,000,
and a key to all the
{Snes doors so you ‘can commence busi-

ness at the usual hour; except my per- |

sonal notes, $4900, which I have de-
stroyed, but the collateral, 49 shares
of stock, you will get.

If you will meet Chandler with the
papers duly executed—you will find the
company’s seal in drawer at end of Den-
man desk—any time between 6 and 9

o’clock on Monday morning you will |

get all the above as stated
and Ke ready for business—the loser of
just $20,000—reiuse to execute and de-
liver these papers by the hour named,
and all.the papers and securities—

valued at over $00,000, none of which, '

except the company’s notes has the

do it—and you yourself well know at
the lowest estimate it will cost you not
less than from $100,009 to $200,000 of
the above, besides the trouble to get the |
balance—and_ besides this loss in actuai |
money, just imagine the cost to the!
company through loss of confidence of |
the public and the absolute’ suspension
of business for at least a month.

To sum up, accept the conditions and
lose $20,000, which the peopie need not
know; reject them and lose—maike your
estimate out of the $900,000 and
be compelled to absolutely suspend
business—you cannot pay any checks,
as you, have _no_ balance books
to go by and vou dare not draw on
New York.and San Francisco, for both
accounts are wrong. I have made a
memorandum and left it in the safe of

Respectfully, E. ALBERTSON. ~
DIRECTIONS TO REACH CHANDLER.

Get a row boat and one man to row for
you (if you want him) over to Brown’s
point. Before rounding the point and
|about 40 rods this side you will see a
pole sticking,in the bluff (near the top)
}and a white handkerchief attached to it.
At this place between -the hours of
6 and 9 o’clock Monday morning,

August 24, land your boat and leave;

your oarsman in it. You will at once
see Chandler, who will direct you how
to reach him. Whenthere hand him
the three papers, and if duly signed,
| witnessed and acknowleiged, he will

at once sign receipt for them.

Any attempt to intimidate or parley
with Chandler will be of no avail, and
will only résult to your disadvantage,
and if'yoncome with more than one
;man or have any boat to follow or pre-
cede you, or snould you fail to be there
by 9 o’clock sharp, Chandler will be
gone and all the books and papers
will be destroyed by fire. :

Your only hope of recovering those
papers, valuables, ete., will be for you
to carry. out ‘these instructions to the
letter. —

I deliveréd the agreements to Fred N.
Chandler, an ‘accomplice of Albertson,
on Brown’s point Sunday morning. —

The agreement was that the Fidelity
Trust Company, in consideration of the
return of the securities, the said com-
pany agreed not to prosecute said Al-
bertson; on the back was a receipt

we were not to _ prosecute

HOW R. B. ALBERTSON IS INVOLVED.

}and that he was cognizan
‘of the whole affair throughout and was,

the part of E. Albertson and Fre

L. D. Campbell: “I saw the agree

to me. The agreement was 4
stipulation on the part oO
the Fidelity Trust Company not_ tc
prosecute Mr. Albertson and Mr,

was nothing inthe agreement to indi-
cate that the bank had been robbed in
the manner that it had been, but there
was enough to indicate that some wrong:
ful act had been committed.

taken from the bank, but cans state
