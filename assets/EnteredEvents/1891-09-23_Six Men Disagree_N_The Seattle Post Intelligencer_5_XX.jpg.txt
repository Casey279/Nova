SIX MEN DISAGREE.

Sullivan’s Man McKay Must
Have Another Trial.

AT LEAST ONE STUBBORN JUROR.

Three Gilman Strikers Bound Over for
Assault — Marshal Gibbons Fined
Again—Robbery Case Dismissed.

P. D. McKay, who assisted M. C. Sullivan and
Tsaac Evans in the abduction of R. B. Albertson
and W. E. Bailey on September 19, will have
a new trial on the charge of assaulting R. B.
Albertson at that time, the jury in the first trial
having failed to agree upon a verdict after being
out twelve hours. The jury reported to Justice
Von Tobel at 12:30 o’clock yesterday that the
only thing agreed upon was a disagreement,
and the court, after satisfying itseif that the six
men would never look atthe matter with one
mind, discharged them from further service.

The jury was kept locked ip a room from mid-
night until noon and six men had their coats off
discussiug the case in all of its bearings all of
the time. It is said that five men spent all their
energies trying to convince one that the verdict
should be against the defendant, but one man
bad made up his mind and nothing could move
him. Under the circumstances au agreement
was out of the question, and every member of
the jury was anxious toimpress that fact upon
the court in order that another iong siege might
be avoided.

McKay was held upon his old bond for another
hearing, which was by agreemeut of cousel
fixed for next Monday at 10 o'clock. The prose-
cution announces that the case will be vigor-
ously pushed until a verdict is reached.
