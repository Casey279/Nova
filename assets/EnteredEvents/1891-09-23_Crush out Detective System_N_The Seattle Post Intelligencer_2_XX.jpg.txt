Crush Out the Detective System.
Hamilton Herald.

Though there is not one scintilla of evidence
to convict Mr. R. B. Albertson, he was
under bonds to answer in the superior court to
the grave charge of complicity in the bank rob
bery. It is not strange that indignation in Se
attle over the outrage is at fever heat. To im-
piant such a stain upon the character of an in-
uocent man is noslightthing. The state is be
coming incensed at the outrageous abuses of
this so-called detective system, and it must be
crushed out.
