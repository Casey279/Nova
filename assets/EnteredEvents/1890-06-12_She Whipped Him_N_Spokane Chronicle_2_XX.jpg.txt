She Whipped Him,
SEATTLE, June 11.—Agnes Wood-
ward, a woman of low repute, to-
day horsewhipped Kalkasa, a jug-
gler performing at Cort’s theatre.
Kalkasa had used disparaging re-
marks about the woman, who over-
heard the talk. She waited until he
appeared to go to theatre, when she
sprang upon him with a rawhide,
cutting him across the head three
times. A crowd gathered, and the
woman stepped into a store hurried-
ly, asking for brushes and pretend-
ing to make a purchase. After the
crowd dispersed she appeared on the
street. Kalkasa started on a run

after the assault was made.
