The preliminary examination of R. B.
Albertson of Seatile, before Justice
Sharp yesterday afternoon, brought out
the whole story of the Fidelity bank
robbery which has never heretofore been
fuily told. The story is one of the most
surprising in all the history of bank rob-
bing. The tone, as well as the matter
itself, of the letters and documents,
show that the robbery was most cooly
and carefully planned, and when it is
remembered that Albertson was among
all men, the one le: likely to be sus-
pected of such an offense, the story be-
comes all the more surprising.

Rk. B, Albertson, who was the accused
party at the hearing yesterday, is a
cousin of the absconding cashier. He
is the man who was arrested last Thurs-
day evening in Seattle and subsequently
rescued by Judge Burke, who appears
as his attorney, and by a posse of othtr
friends. He was attended in court by
Mr. Bailey, who was with him at the
time of the arrest, and who stood by
him so stubbornly while he was in
charge of the officers, and who is evi-
dently standing by him confidently still.
His law partners, Messrs. Preston and
Donworth, appeared with Judge Burke
as his counsel, and he was also accom-
panied by a half dozen other iriends
who listened at the surprising story
told with great apparent interest.

Albertson is a man of rather small
stature, of slim build, square features,
deep set eyes anda long drooping mus-
tache. He bore himself through the
trying ordeal of the afternoon remark-
ably well, considering the serious nature
of the offense for which he is charged,
and which it subsequently appeared he
had confessed, although declaring that
he did not know who the parties con-
cerned in the transaction were, or the|

full nature of the transaction itself. |
When Mr. Kochkersperger began to
tell the story of his interview with him
and gradually to lead up to the dis-
closure of his conversation in regard to
the drawing of the incriminating papers,
he was evidently nervous and showed
much uneasiness. During most of the
proceedings, however, he leaned back |
on the shoulder of Mr. Bailey, who kept |
his right arm thrown around him, and
across the back of his chair, and!
closely watched both him and the pro-
ceedings which so closely effected his in-
terest and reputation. When at times,
Judge Burke, during a cross-examina-
tion, seemed to need prompting, Mr.
Bailey was quite as quick to see the
int as was Albertson, and even more
requently rendered his counsel a sag-
estion. When, during the cross-exam-
ination of Kocbkersperger, Judge Burke
asked, when he showed Albertson’s dis
patch to Sullivan, both leaned over
quickly and whispered a suggestion to
the judge with equal earnestness. The
law partners were attentive to all that
was said by each witness, and evidently
very thoughtful.

The court room was packed almost to
suffocation, Every inch of space was
occupied, and at times the atmosphere
was almost stifling. The crowd, how-
ever, was too thoroughly interested to
be, im any sense disorderly, and no
demonstration, either of favor or dis-
favor, was attempted.

It may be noted in passing that Judge
Burke’s conduct of the defense would
certainly not be more earnest, and it is
doubtiui if it would be changed in any
way, if the defaulting Albertson were on
trial, and he were his counsel. The
cross-examination of T. B, Wallace was
devoted almost entirely to a fruitless at-
tempt to confuse him, by exacting and
insisting upon exact statements in re-
gard to losses, and the values of various
papers that no witness could be expected
to carry in his mind, or to state ac-
eurately without reference to his books.
Mr, Wallace was thoroughly composed,
andin fact made an excellent witness.
Why the judge wished to confuse him or
to break down his testimony, it is im-
possible to say, as it in no apparent way
effected the cause of the accused person
on trial. It was the story of the rob-
bery and the discovery of it, and the
subsequent communication with the
robbers at_ 6 o’clock on Monday mern-
ing, the 24th of August, among the
mists and mosquitoes of Brown’s point.
He did not, in any way, aecuse R. B.
Albertson, further than the papers
which he had presented or deseribed,
laid the groundwork for, or con-
tained the substance of his accusation.
If Edward Albertson had been on trial
of conrse the testimony would have been
convincing, and there would have been
an apparent purpose in weakening its
force; but so fur as the defense of R. B.
Albertson was concerned, it might well
have been left to pass unchallenged.

| Directions to reach Chandler: Get a
rowboat and one man to row for you (if
you want him) and row over to Brown’s
point. Before reaching the point and
about forty rods this side, you will see a
pole stuck in the bluff (near the top) and
«a white handkerchief attached to it. At
this place, between the hours of 6 and 9
o'clock Monday morning, August 24th,
land your boat and leave your oarsman
in it. You will at once see Chandler,
who will direct you how to reach him.
When there, hand him the three papers,
and, if duly signed, witness and
acknowledged, he will place in your
hands the articles mentioned in the agree-
ment, when you will at once sign receipt
for them.

Any attempt to intimidate or parley
with Chandler would be of no avail, and
would only result to your disadvantage;
and if you come with more than one
map, or have any boat to follow or pre-
cede you, or shall fail to béthere at 9
o'clock, sharp, Chandler wiil be gone,
and all the books and papers will be de-
stroyed by fire.

Your only hope of recovering those pa-
pers, valuables, &c., will be for you to
carry out these instructions to the letter.

Think of calling a man out of bed at
4 o’clock in the morning and giving him
a message of that kind!

Mr. Wallace, as everybody in Tacoma
knows, is a young man who has made
his own way in life, has earned a fortune
and the position he occupies as presi-
dent of the Fidelity Trust company by
his own efforts. He had, of course, in
his experience, acquired some oi the
necessary qualities of character which
would stand him in good stead in an
emergency of this kind. but to be told a
story like this at any hour is enough to
overwhelm anybody. He however sent
for his brother, Hugh C. Wallace, who
is a director in the bank, and who liyes
next door, and together they went to
the house of L. D. Campbell, another
directér and counsel of the bank, who
lives only a few squares away, called
him out of bed and submitted the papers
to him. After a hurried conversation
one of them went for T. D. Powell,
who is Mr. Campbell’s partner, and
also a director of the bank,
for Colonel Griggs, Paul Schulze
and George Brown and other mem-
bers of the board. By advice of Messrs.
Campbell & Poweli Mr. Wallace and
Mr. Powell repaired to the latter’s office
to execute the triplicate agreement en-
closed with the letter. Hugh C. Wallace
went to the water front to engage a boat-
man, andin due course of time T. B.
was started on his strange trip to
Brown’s point. Arriving there he found
the post which the letter informed him
would indicate the whereabouts of the
man he was to meet. As the boat
touched the shore a yoice called from the
top of the bank, “Come up here.’”’ Mr.
Wallace clambered up, and after a brief
parley, in which he showed the papers
to the man in waiting, who is the Fred
N, Chandler now known to be Albert-
son’s confederate, and together they
went in search of the hidden securities.
Chandler wended his way through the
thick woods, through which they
waded about for a distance of probably
a half mile. Finally he seemed
to become confused, and for a time Mr.
Wallace feared he would not be able to
tind the precious documents they were
in search of. After clambering about
through the brush he finally found the
package which he delivered. Then Mr.
Wallace was led to another point some
distance away, where after looking be-
hind logs and stumps and under fallen
timbers of various sorts, another pack-
age was discovered and turned over as
the first had been. Then the two walked
| back together toward the water.

| Wallace,

Mr. Wallace describes the conyersa- |

tion which took place during this tramp
as brief and altogether laconic. It con-
sisted in most part of questions which
he propounded to his guide, philosopher
and enemy, and very brief and none too
willing replies. He was given to under-
stand, by what was said, that even a
thought of pursuit was useless, as he
and Albertson had laid all the plans
which they had not disclosed, as well
and carefully as those which the letters
and documents had revealed. He re-
turned to his boat and thence to the
city, where he met the officers of the
Trust company, and the returned secur-
ities were examined, the cash in the
bank counted, and the full extent of
the robbery determined as fully as it
could be. “It was found that somewhere
between $16,000 and $17,000 in cash was
missing. Only bank notes had been
taken, the gold and silver being left un-
disturbed. Probably they were too dith-
cult to carry. It was afterward learned
by comnninicating with the bank's
correspondents in New York and San
Francisco that the accounts had been
depleted to the extent of $2000 or $5000
more, but the accurate amount has not
yet been determined, because the Aug-
ust drafts have not been received from
New York. Every document of what-
ever sort that had heen abstracted from
the bank had been returned and is ac-
counted for.

Mr. Wallace was asked whether he
had ever met R. B. Albertson, the ac-
cused, in connection with this matter
and replied that le had once, and only
once. A few days after the defalcation
oecurred, and after Cohoon had been ar-
rested, he had called at the house and
told of a visit he had made to Mrs. Al-
bertson and Mrs, Cohoon.

‘ollowing the messenger came H.C.
whose evidence pertained
wholly to what was done after his
brother received the letter, and threw no
light on the robbery.

Mr. Powell told how himself and Mr.
Wallace had secured the triplicateagree-
ment as required, in his office. When
asked to deseribe the agreement he was
not able to do so, saying that he had not
examined it carefully, but had observed
that it began in legal form with ‘Know
all men by these presents,’’ and that
generally if seemed to have been drawn
by a lawyer. Appended to it was a form
for acknowledgment. The three forms
had been written with a pen. and had
not been printed with typewriter. He
had also been one of the committee who
examined the securities on their return,
and had helped to count the cash found
in the vault.

L, D. Campbell§also described the ex-
periences of the day, but was unable to
give any description of the triplicate
agreement furtner than it seemed to be
in legal form. All of the witnesses
agreed that no copy had been kept.
Judge Burke, by one ef his questions,
drew attention tothe fact that it had
been drawn in triplicate. The reason
for this is not explained. It is easy to
see why two copies were drawn, as there
were two rascals at least concerned, and
each of them evidently wanted a copy,
but who the third copy was intended for
is not here explained, if indeed it ever
will be.

When Mr. Kochkersperger was put on
the stand the real battle of the day be-
gan. Mr. Albertson evidently felt that
the sensational part of the evidence, so
far as it concerned him, was coming,
and he drew closer to his friend and
supporter. Mr. Kochkersperger is a
short, rotund man, with a great deal of
self-confidence and enough courage not
to permit himself to be put down, and
the sparring between him and Judge
Burke was spirited, and at times even
exciting. He told, with great delibera-
tion, that he was the general western
agent for the Fidelity and Security com-
pany of New York, with an office in
Chicago; that he had been telegraphed
by the main office to come here, as one
of the persons for whom the company
had giveu bondsin the sum of $10,000
had defaulted. His business here was
to adjust matters with the company, for
whose benefit this bond had been
issued. He described how he had gone
to work on the case, and how, shortly
after his arrival here, he had_ received

the following letter:

He told a!

Mr. BE. Fermor Hall, New York—Drsan
Sr There isa dispute of some $20,000
which this company has lost and they
will try te recover $10,000 of it under the
bond which you issued to them, guar-
anteeing my fidelity, ete., No. 51,084. To
give you the money and at the same time
to lessen chances of my being prosecuted,
I herewith return to you the bond and
renewal, neither of which has ever been
out of my possession.

Their records do not show that they
paid this, so all you will have to do is to
refuse payment, else deny existence, or
else declare same has _ been cancelled
several months ago. You know your
business. If you want to get out of this
you know what todo. Yours truly,

E, ALBERTSON.

I have written to Palmer & Son that
papers are received and shall have at-
tention. I wish you would write to R.
B. Albertson, attorney at law, Seattle,
Wash., (personal) and advise him of
your action on the within. He may be
able to advise you in the matter. What-
ever you write him will be strictly con-
fidential.

When the letter was produced, Judge
Burke, as he had done when the other
documents were proffered, and as is
usual in such trials, demanded to see it
before it was read, and was permitted to
do so. He objected to it at first on the
ground that it was not the orignal, but
only a copy, as it purported to be. After
a little discussion of the matter between
himself and Mr. Snell, the district at-
torney, he allowed the letter to be read.
When Judge Burke began to examine it
all his associates, as well as Albertson
and his friend Bailey, crowded about
him and eargerly read it over his
shoulder. Nevertheless, when Snell be-
gan to read it aloud in court Albertson
tidgeted about uneasily in his chair, and
evidently regarded it as a very awkward
document as affecting his case. Mr.
Kochkersperger. as soon as he was per-
mitted todo so, explained that "he had
telegraphed for the original letter, but
that it had not yet arrived. He then
proceeded to tell how, after re-
ceiving this letter, he had written
Mr. Albertson a long letter, asking him
tocome to Tacoma, and advising him
generally as to the nature of the inter-
view he wished to have with him. In
reply he got a telegram saying that he
was obliged to go_to New Westminster
at once, and could not call at the time
designated, but would call later. He
did call on the following Sunday, and
met Mr. Kochkersperger at his room in
the hotel. The interview had been held
behind a locked door, and possibly i
the presence of a concealed witne:
though Mr. Kochkersperger profe:
not to know whether a third party w
present or not. At first Mr. A
had refused to discuss the matter, and
had proposed leaving the room, but
upon being assured tnat the door was
locked and that the conversation would
be confidential, he gradually unbosemed
himself and admitted that he had drawn
an agreement ilar to the one exe-

in

ented in tri ate, as above, bi

only in duplicate. He had been in-

him that his name was not Ross, but
Chandler; that he. was one of
the parties for whom the agreement had
been drawn, and that Edward Albertson
was the other. Mr. R. B. Albert for
some time re dto convey the er
to his cousin's wife in Tacoma, but of-
fered Chandler a stamp and envelope in
order that he might send it by mail, but
this he declined to do, and insisted that
R. B, Albertson should deliver After
long and urgent consultation he finally
consented and did deliver the letter. On
the same occasion he called upon
T. B. Wallace at the bank, ard de-
manded, as Mr. Wallace in his evidence
had deseribed, that he should tell him
the whereabouts of Cohoon, who had
been arrested, but whose place of cap-
tivity was not, at that time, known. Mr.
Wallace declined to give him any in-
formation and he subsequently returned
to Seattle.

The cross-examination of this witness
by Judge Burke was sharp and loud and
at times most exciting. The judge in-
sisted upon showing that Kochkersper-
ger was a detective and Kochkersperger
as flatly insisted that he was not. The
judge insisted on knowing what his oc-
cupation had been, from the earliest
times, and he was at last forced to ad-
mit that he had for a time worked for
the Pinkerton agency in Philadelphia.
The fact was made much of, evidently to
Mr. Kochkersperger’s discomfiture, al-
though not very seriously effecting his
evidence. The crowd enjoyed the spar-
ring immensely, and while both the wit-
ness and the attorney perspired freely,
neither offended the dignity of the court.

The next witness was John H. Mc-
Graw, president of the First National
bank of Seattle. He was the coolest wit-
ness of the day, and told his story in a
straightforward manner without inter-
ruption from either of the attorneys. He
had been appealed to by Kochkersperger
and Sullivan to call upon Albertson and
ask him to make some further dis-
closures in regard to the  rob-
bers, the whereabouts of the rebbers
and his communications with them. He
had related to Mr. McGraw his story of
how he came to draw the papers, prac-
tically as it had been told to Kochker-
sperger. He also told him that Chandler
had come to him three days after the
robbery was discovered, with a letter for
Mrs. Albertson, and how he had de-
livered it to her. He told how he came
to draw the agreement in duplicate, and
gave the story in every detail practically
as it had been told before.

The court at this point adjourned un-
til this morning, when the case will
again be taken up. As the charge on
which the accused had been arrested
bad been withdrawn and a new one sub-
stituted, the warrant in the latter one
only being served a few moments be-
foreé,a new bond was required in the
same sum as heretofore. It was given.
by Mr. Albertson and his friends, and
they left the court room,

The prosecution was conducted by
Prosecuting Attorney Snell alone, al-
though the defense is represented by
three lawyers. Mr. Snell’s work leit
nothing to be complained of, though
prudence would dictate the employ-
ment of an assistant in a matter of this
importance. One mind can hardly
watch all the threads ina long examina-
tion like this, which is likely to be fol-
lowed by a closely-contested trial, for
which this only lays the ground-work.
