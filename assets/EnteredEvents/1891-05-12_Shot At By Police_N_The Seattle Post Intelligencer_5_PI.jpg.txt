SHOT AT BY POLICE.

A Variety Performer Tempts s Poor
Marksman orn the Force.

Great excitement was caused at 11:30
oâ€™clock last night on South Fifth and
Washington streets by the firing of five
pistol shots in rapid succession. The shots
were fired by Officer Hogie at a man named
Frank Martin, whom he arrested on a
charge of robbery. Martin was in a den of
sin on Jackson street, kept by Agnes
Woodward, and he was accompanied by
an old man. The old man was drunk,
and the woman charges that Martin
picked his pockets of $40, and on her
story the officer arrested Martin. At the
corner of South Fifth and Washington
streets, on the way to police headquarters,
Martin broke away and ran down South
Fifth street to Main, closely followed by
the officer who emptied his revolver with-
out being abie to bring his man to a stand
still, At Main street Martin jumped over
the railing of the street to the tide
flats, a distance of about forty feet, and
sought refuge under the electric light
works. A half dozen officers hunted about
in vain and were about to give up the job
when Detective Brown was seen, covered
with dirt and cobwebs, crawling out from
under the building with Martin, quite as
dirty, by the collar.

Martin was taken to jail and booked on
a charge of robbery. He is a variety
theater performer.
