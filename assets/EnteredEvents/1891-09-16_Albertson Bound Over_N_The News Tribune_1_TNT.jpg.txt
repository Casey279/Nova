ALBERTSON
BOUND OVER,

ALBERTSON BOUND OVER.

At the conclusion of Judge
Burke’s address, Justice Harry H.
Sharp delivered the following statement :
] have listened patiently and have had
to weigh carefully all the ‘evi-
dence adduced in this case.
| have been sitting here as
a committing magistrate, holding an in-
vestigation merely, and not as a court of
original jurisdiction to try acase. I
bay e not that power or authority.

{am not here for the trial of this case.
] cannot say that Mr. Albertson is
guilty. As ‘I have said, Lam merely
holding an investigation to see whether
there isa probable « cause, as it is termed
in law, of the defendant’s guilt.

Probable cause is defined in many
ways.

It means a reasonable ground for sus-
picion supported by circumstances; an
apparent state of facts found’ to
exist upon reasonable inquiry.

‘ue defendant here, Mr. Albertson, is
unfortunate. He certainly made a grave
nd serious mistake when he drew the
contract or release which he admits
himself to have drawn.

Whether he knew before chiles re-
leases W were drawn, as to the particular

vurpose for which’ they were to be used
i know not and cannot pass upon. He ‘gs
uniortunate in having drawn any such
documents. The letters written by Ed.
A bertson to the Casualty Company of
sew York and R. B. Albertson might
haye easily been written without
connecting this defendant in anyway
end still a probable cause is shown in
seid letters that Mr. Albertson might
have had full knowledge of the intended
conmission of this crime.

Again this defendant interviewed
Chandler in this defendant’s office in
Seattle after this robbery. Chand-
ler hai $1000 which he wished
Mr. A. to return to the bank
This defendant then knew the bank
had been robbed. Whether it was this
defendant’s duty to have Chandler ar-
rested, | will not pass upon, but in
relusng to do this there ig
shown a probable cause of defendant’s
knowledge of the crime.

In not inquiring who his friend was
is shown another “probable - cause that
elendant might have known who
friend was without asking this man
Ross, alias Chandler, who called.

In the destruction of the’ ‘istter to
himself from Edward Albertson; the de-
faulter, there is probable cause shown
that this letter contained something
which might tend to criminate some
one,

Probable cause may be shown in sev-
eral instances as it occurs to me through-
out this case.

\iter reviewing this case and the
testimony and ‘the very able way
in which counsel have conducted
It oi find that there is a
probable cause in this case and will hold
this defendant, to use counsel’s expres-
sion, ior a ‘fair trial to the end” in the
Superior court.
