BEATTLAF, Sept. 10.—[Apectal. }—
The city is thrown into the wildest
excitement by the kidnaping of
William FE. Bailey, the young mill-
lonaire, and R. B. Albertson, his at-
torney, this afternoon by Detective
M. C. Sullivan, Although the ab-
duction was made at 5:30 o’clock
on Second street, when it
was crowded, no facts are obtainable
and the whereabouts of the men are
unknown, although it is supposed
the party is heading for Tacoma.
Bailey is the young man whose
father is a millionaire of Harrisburg,
Penn. Young Bailey is worth at
least $2,000,000, he is the owner of
the big Harrisburg block
here, andthe president and direc-
tor of several banks and a large real
estate owner. Heis also owner of |
the Press-Times. Albertson is a
second cousin of Albertson, the ab-
sconding cashier of the Fidelity
Trust Company, of Tacoma, and it
Is supposed Sullivan abducted him
in order to get some information
about the absconder.

The kidnaping occurred at 5:30.
Sullivan enticed the two men into
a closed carriage and it is supposed
held a revolver at their heads until
they were out of the city. When
the cab was two miles out of town,
Bailey and Albertson were call-
ing for help, but Sullivan
threatened to shoot whoever at-
tempted torescue them. A rumor
has been circulated that Bailey is
suspected of having securities stolen
from the bank in his possession. A
posse of police and deputy sheriffs
are out on horseback chasing the
hack, andaspecial train with over
100 leading citizens has started for
Tacoma.

Itis learned that Sullivan drove
to Black River Junction, nine miles
distant, where the hack was dis-
missed. )

LATER PARTICULARS,

Detective Sullivan and his two
deputies were captured at Black
River Junction on the arrival of the
train there at 11 o’clock by Chief
Rogers anda posse of special dep-
uties, and the whole party has
just returned on the regular
train from Tacoma, Albertson and
Bailey were brutally treated and
bear marks of choking and hand-
cuffs, Sullivan had a Pierce county
warrant for Albertson, charging hii
with having knowledge of his
cousin’s whereabouts. This war-
rant was not endorsed by the King
county officials,

Sullivan and his men caught
Albertson and Bailey as they were
going to dinner at the Rainier club
and one of them told Alberison he
had a warrant for bis arrest. Al-
bertson demanded to see the war-
rant. The detective said: ‘Get
into the hack and we will drive to
your office,’ Bailey offered
to go with his friend,
but the detectives demurred to
this, but finally both Albertson and
Bailey got into the carriage. The
doors were shut and the two armed
detectives held and choked their
prisoners while the hack was driven
away through the heart of the city
and not until they had reache
South Seattle were the violent
hands taken off Then Bailey
and Albertson commenced crying
forhelp. They forced the window
open and passers-by recognized them
and gavechase. Sullivan, who was
on the box with the driver, drew a
revolver and made the pursuers
turn, at the same time saying to
Bailey, ‘Put your head in that
wiudow or I’ll blow it off.’ The
deputies again treated their victims
roughly.

The patty drove to Black River
Junction, where the driver rebelled
and the party ieft the carriage to
wait for the train. It happened to
be two hours late, and when it did
arrive Chief Rogers was
aboard, with Judge Burke
and about fifty others. Sullivan
at first refused to be arrested, but
finally gnte up. The whole party
returned, Bailey was not wanted
at all, but was taken because he was
with Albertson. Sullivan and his
deputies have been put in the
county jail and can’t get bonds,
