Tacoma, Oct., 22.—A reliable citizen
said tonight to a correspondent of the
Post Intelligencer: “Two days ago
Deputy Sheriff Ike Evang was let out
of the sheriff's office, but the thing
has been kept quiet. Evans helped
Sullivan kidnap R. B. Albertson and
W. E. Bailey at Seattle, and his com-
mission was cancellod and he was dis-
missed for assisting him in his dirty
work.” Sheriff Price could not be
found up to midnight.
