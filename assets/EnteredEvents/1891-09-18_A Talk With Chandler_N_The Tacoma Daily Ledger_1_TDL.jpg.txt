A TALK WITH CHANDLER.

He Says that Bis Arrest Will Bring Some-
thing Elsc te Light.

Marsurte.p, Sept. 17.—S. W. Condon,
prosecuting attorney for the second ju-
dicial district, has just arrived from
Gardiner and gives the following account
of aninterview he had with Chandler:
Chandler talked freely with Mr. Condon,
and denies having purchased tickets for
Engene at Tacoma as reported, but did
not deny or confirm that they had been
in Eugene. He exonerates all persons
excepting himself and Albertson from
any complicity in the affair, saying
“they have got all who had ade d to
do with it,’’ and that great injustice had
been done innocent jes in connect-
ing their names with it. Continuing,
Chandler said: “‘I do not fear as far as
the actions in this matter is concerned,
but there is another matter that it will
bring to the surface that does
worry me. I had had half a
chance they never would have caught
me. It was my loyalty to Albertson
that brought me into this predicament.
It is not the wound so much that wor-
ries Albertson, but he has been deeply
concerned on account of his wife and
child and has at various times, while we
bave been together, almost decided to
give himself up, and would have done so
bnt for his wife and child and the dis-
grace it would bring onthem. We had
an encounter with a bear whilein the
woods. Ishot the bear, which must
have weighed 400 pounds, and thought I
had killed him, and went up to himand
he tore my pants with his claws. 1 had
to stab him five or six times before he

gave up. We have been eat-
ing the meat, and I tell you
that bear meat is _ first rate,

but is alittle coarse, and I conld tell
somebody where they could get lots of
good bear meat right now. I have been
back to Tacoma two or three times since
this thing occurred, where men have
talked to men about this affair, not
knowing who I was. I even talked to a
man who claimed to be one of Sullivan's)
detectives. I have been in the detective
business myself, in Iowa Massa-
cbusette, and have been selected for
important duty and have, in fact, made

arrests myself, bat never had

He replied, “and also admit

cles were found in the hotel at Florence.
Chandler, continuing, said: ‘I had with
mea good deal of very valuable cloth-
ing. They say wine and women have

something to do with my present mis-
| fortune. Yes, Ve admit that I
| have a weakness in that direction.”
|Chandler was given an opportunity to

financial part of the affair, but was not
disposed to do so.

“IT was surprised—completely sur-
prised when captured,”’ said he. © ‘Four

ered us with their guns. If I had had

wife or children, but I have others to

where as I desired since this thing oc-

one, was long, although not heavy, and
that, as you see, is gone, which changes
my looks. 1 can disguise myself to look
older, so no one could identify me.”
