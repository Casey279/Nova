THE KIDNAPING TRIAL

McKay's Second Uearing Tomorrow—
Disagreement of the Last Jury.

Tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock the trial of
P. D. McKay for assisting M. C. Sullivan and
Isaac Evans in kidnaping R. B. Albertson and
W. E, Bailey, will be begun for a second time in
Justice Von Tobel’s court, Since the testimony
for both McKay and Evans is the same, itis
possible that the two men may be tried together,

The state has good hopeof securing convie-
tion this time. At the last trial the jury failed
to reach a verdict. At first, it is said, they
stood four for conviction and the imposition of
the full penalty of the law; one for conviction
with a lighter penalty,and one for absolute
acquittal. After some hours of debate the five
for conviction offered a eompromise by which
a verdict for conviction should be obtained and
a nominal penalty of $1 inflicted, but the recal-
citrant juror refused a compromise,
