One of the<br />tirsl and largest veins discovered here was<br />on a portion of the Reed ranch, now<br />owned by O&#39;Mailon «£ Co., a<br />portion of which ranch is used as<br />a brick yard. From old timers<br />it is learned that this deposit was located<br />some twenty years but at that time<br />purchase of the laud could not be consum<br />mated. and after digging a shaft to a depth<br />of sixty feet the projectors had to abandon<br />their undertaking. This hrst-known coal<br />plant in the county is within 40U yards of<br />Alto station, on the uarrow gauge road to<br />San Rafael.

She tells us that they read<br />Zola and Tolstoi and medical works, and<br />learn to fear men and marriage; that they<br />enter professions and earn financial inde<br />pendence, and feel no need of life partners,<br />whom they might possibly have to sup<br />port, and mat they talk with their mothers,<br />and tind out how many lonely moments<br />she has passed in her married life, and they<br />dread similar experiences, and decide that<br />single life is preferable.<br />In discussing this article, which has<br />caused a great deal of comment, I would<br />say that, in the first place, the statement<br />is wrong.<br />Girls do not marry as young as they did<br />in the days of our grandmothers, but they<br />eventually marry as frequently as in any<br />former period of history, and the per<br />centage of hopeless spinsters is no greater<br />than it ever was.<br />In our large cities there is an evidently<br />increasing reluctance on the part of men<br />to assume the responsibilities of married<br />life.<br />1 have heard ft number of young men<br />declare thai the society reports of the<br />sumptuous homes and brilliant entertain<br />ments of the very rich, who form a colony<br />In our large cities, discouraged them from<br />attempting to establish « home.<br />Men care far more for public opinion, far<br />more about making a fine show in the<br />world than women do, when we come to<br />analyze them carefully. Yet they do not<br />analyse themselves. Many a mau will tell<br />yon he cannot afford to keep op a home as<br />the young ladies of today desire to live,<br />while the fact is a dozen young ladies of<br />his acquaintance would be perfectly con<br />tented to live quietly ana unostenta<br />tiously. but it is his own ambition which<br />stand in the way. It seems to be the im<br />pression of young men in large towns that<br />all women are mercenary, and that all<br />girls are consumed with an intense desire<br />to shine as social leaders.<br />They know whst this means in the way<br />of expense, and they dare not think of<br />marriage without a large fortune in the<br />background.<br />This is unfair to scores of nice girls, who,<br />all unobserved by these cynical young<br />men, are waiting, not for a fortune, but an<br />honest heart worthy of their love to be<br />offered them.<br />The false estimate of our sex explains to<br />a certain extent the delays in marriage;<br />and the financial independence of women<br />renders them less eager to undeceive their<br />detractors and prove themselves worthy<br />and desirable helpmeets for these cynical<br />men than they might otherwise be. But<br />to assert that women live past their youth<br />and into old age single from choice is posi<br />tively absurd, and the reasons which Mrs.<br />Wells has given for this &quot;choice,&quot; as she<br />believes it, render it still more absurd.<br />I do not believe the single woman of 30<br />lives who could not be persuaded to<br />change her lot if the right man urged per<br />sistently enough.<br />&quot;The right man&quot; does not always ap<br />pear, however, and other men plead in<br />vain. Yet, no matter how valiantly she<br />may assert that she is contented trttn her<br />single lot, she is not. If she is. there is<br />something wrong about the construction<br />of her heart.<br />The woman heart that does not cry for<br />its true mate, no matter what other&quot; joys<br />and ambitions it has in life, by the time it<br />is 30, is not a natural heart.<br />The woman who finds herself satisfied<br />with single life because she has &quot;a paying<br />profession,&quot; or because she has read &quot;Tol<br />stoi and Zola,&quot; and medical works, or be<br />cause &quot;her mother passed some lonely<br />moments,&quot; must be a curious being.<br />Lungs must supply the place of heart in<br />her breast, tepid water the place of blood<br />in her veins.<br />But I assert that she does not exist. Let<br />the persistent lover, who is even half way<br />her ideal, prove to her that he is in dead<br />earnest, and as honest as earnest, and pro<br />fession, Zola, &quot;peripatetic works,&quot; and<br />maternal warnings will vanish like the<br />nightmare of a dreamer&#39;s brain. and she<br />will prove to him that her content was<br />only superficial and welcome his coming<br />as tne earth welcomes the sunrise.<br />But every year the American woman is<br />becoming more exacting in her demands<br />of what a husband should be.<br />A mere husband is not enough; she does<br />not accept the first offer, &quot;for fear she will<br />not have another,&quot; as I once heard an old<br />lady say she did—she waits to find the man<br />witn tne husband. As woman reaches<br />higher standards herself, ner ideals are<br />higher.<br />Just now we have more fine women than<br />fine men in large rities.<br />But the men will be forced into elevating<br />themselves after a generation or two. They<br />will be shamed into it or else a complete<br />revolution of our social system will take<br />place, and men will become the housekeet&gt;-<br />ers and cradle-rockers, and the women the<br />financiers. Should the latter contingency<br />result, and women be vested with all of<br />man&#39;s present power and privilege, she<br />will certainly prove to the world that she<br />does not prefer single life, and no one will<br />question: &quot;Why do not girls marry ?&quot;<br />TUB ZOLAISTIC VIEW*<br />The mighty Zolaistic Movement now<br />Engrosses us—a miasmatic breath<br />Blown from the slums. We paint life as it is,<br />The hideous side of it, with careful pains,<br />Making a god of the dull commonplace,<br />For have we uot the old gods overthrown<br />And set up strangest idols? We would clip<br />Imagination&#39;s wings and kill delight.<br />Our sole art being to leave nothing out<br />That renders art offensive. Not for us<br />Madonnas leaning from their starrv thrones<br />Ineffable, nor any heaven-wrought dream<br />O: sculptor or of poet; we prefer<br />Such nightmare visions as in morbid brains<br />Takeshage and substance, thoughts that taint<br />And make all life unlovely.
