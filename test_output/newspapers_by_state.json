        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe <cite>Washington Herald</cite> first appeared on October 8, 1906 with the aim of upholding serious journalism in an era of muckraking. The paper was founded and edited by Scott C. Bone, an eminent newspaperman and former managing editor of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014727/\"><cite>Washington Post</cite></a> from 1888 until his dismissal by new owner John R. McLean in 1905. Bone published the 16-page morning daily to challenge the position of the <cite>Post</cite> as the foundation of Washington journalism. At its peak, the <cite>Herald</cite> enjoyed a circulation of roughly 50,000, and surpassed the <cite>Post</cite> in daily sales. It occupied offices at 734 Fifteenth Street, in close vicinity to newspaper row in the city's northwest quadrant, and its editorial board included prominent figures such as managing editor William P. Spargeon, the first president of the National Press Club. Bone himself garnered respect in the newspaper world for his work with the <cite>Post</cite>, and later the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045604/\"><cite>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</cite></a>, and went on to become governor of Alaska.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe paper created a niche for itself based on substantive news reporting, displaying the motto \"A Paper of Quality\" on its masthead. An early advertisement proclaimed the arrival of the <cite>Herald</cite> as a \"clean, compact, newsy newspaper that would appeal to the intelligent and discriminating clientele of Washington.\" Its front page most prominently featured discussions of domestic politics, followed by stories of international scope, and the occasional newsworthy crime or personal interest story. The Herald also included a page each on sports, market news, and women's interest, plus a slew of advertisements and classifieds. Its Sunday edition attempted to rival that of the <cite>Post</cite> with a 30-page edition featuring special sections on society news, literature, theater, and serialized fiction.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tAlthough the <cite>Herald</cite> rose to be one of the top three penny dailies in Washington, it underwent a series of transformations after its second decade. In 1913, Clinton T. Brainard, president of the McClure Syndicate Service, purchased the paper. In 1922, the <cite>Herald</cite> was taken over by William Randolph Hearst who appointed one of the first female newspaper editors of the era - Eleanor Medill \"Cissy\" Patterson of the Medill media dynasty. Cissy Patterson revived the paper and its popularity, and in 1939 she merged it with the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/\"><cite>Washington Times</cite></a> creating the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85040694/\"><cite>Washington Times-Herald</cite></a>. After her death in 1948, however, the paper declined once again. The Herald died an ironic death in 1954 when the Times-Herald was merged with the <cite>Washington Post</cite>. Although named the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024539/\"><cite>Washington Post and Times Herald</cite></a>, the <cite>Post</cite> restored its original name in 1973 and the <cite>Herald</cite> faded into obscurity.</p>\n"

        "\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Washington Critic</em> first appeared on August 31, 1868, and was initially \u201cdevoted chiefly to the criticism of theatrical and music performances\u2026\u201d During its 28-year history, the paper expanded the breadth of its interests and coverage, becoming one of the largest circulating newspapers in Washington, D.C., during the 1880s. The <em>Critic </em>experienced a series of title and management changes over the course of its active years, publishing its final issue in 1896.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe first major change occurred in 1872, when it adopted the title the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014402/\">Daily Critic</a></em><strong>.</strong>\u00a0 By this time the paper\u2019s contents had become more diversified, and the number of articles and advertisements had increased. In 1881, the paper acquired a new title, the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014424/\"><em> Evening Critic</em></a><em>, </em>to reflect its new status as an evening paper. The publishers, now a co-operation called \u201cThe Evening Critic Publishing Company,\u201d increased the price of the paper to two cents, explaining the changes as a necessary reaction to the \u201cgrowth of the city in population, wealth and business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn the decade that followed, circulation more than doubled, growing from 5,000 in 1881 to 13,500 in 1889. In 1885, The<em>Evening Critic </em>became the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82000205/\"><em>Washington Critic</em></a>, to reflect the paper\u2019s \u201clocal habitation.\u201d The <em>Critic</em> remained \u201cessentially a Washington paper\u2014devoted to Washington affairs, freighted with Washington news, an exponent and advocate of Washington interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1888 the<em> Critic, </em>along with the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014727/\"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em>, </em>was bought by a wealthy investor, and the two papers entered into a short-lived partnership through which the<em>Critic </em>appeared as an evening edition of the<em>Post. </em>\u00a0\u00a0From 1889 to 1891, the<em> Critic </em>went through a turbulent period, shifting its management and adopting six different titles. In 1889 alone, the<em>Critic </em>was published under three different consecutive titles: the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014422/\"><em>Capital and Critic</em></a><em>,</em> the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014420/\">Evening Capital and Critic</a></em><em>,</em> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88063022/\"><em>Evening Capital</em></a>.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBy 1890, the paper had again come under new management and for the last time adopted the well-worn title, the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058169/\">Washington Critic</a></em>.\u00a0 In its first edition<em>, </em>the paper promised to provide Washingtonians with concise and objective reporting. The <em>Critic </em>claimed that it was \u201cyoked to no particular interest, to no official set, to no private scheme\u2026[it] will try to give its readers the happenings of the world, in condensed form, from day to day, reserving most of its space for and devoting the major part of its labor to, the affairs of Washington, which, after all, is at once its parent and its prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the beginning and end of both its aim and ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOver the next year, the title of the paper changed twice, first to the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058170/\"><em>Daily Critic</em></a>\u00a0 and then to the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058171/\"><em>Critic</em></a><em>, </em>the later change being \u201cbest suited to the scheme we have adopted\u2014that of compactness and condensation in presenting the news.\u201d In 1891, the paper entered its final period appearing as the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062228/\">Critic and Record\u00a0</a></em> and publishing its last issue in May 1896.</p>\n"

On July 4, 1895, owners renamed it the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024442\"><cite>Morning Times</cite></a>. Financial difficulties, however, soon forced the printers to sell to Charles G. Conn, a Democratic congressman from Indiana. On August 5, 1895, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024441\"><cite>Evening Times</cite></a> was added, and the two editions sold as a combined subscription. The morning edition continued as The <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85054468\"><cite>Times</cite></a> from March 12, 1897, to June 29, 1901, before being renamed the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062245\"><cite> Washington Times</cite></a>.  </p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Conn sold the morning and evening editions in late 1896 to <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014727\"><cite>Washington Post </cite></a>founder Stilson Hutchins (1830-1912).  In 1901 Frank A. Munsey (1854-1925), who was known for his consolidation practices and within the newspaper business as a destroyer of the dailies, purchased the paper and ran it from the Munsey Building, which he had built on E Street in the northwest quadrant of the city. Munsey ceased printing the morning edition in November, 1902, and his evening and Sunday editions became known, simply, as the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749\"><cite>Washington Times</cite></a> (not to be confused with the present-day paper of the same title).</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Shortly after its founding, the evening edition soon became dominant, substantially surpassing the morning paper's circulation. This late afternoon edition competed with the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462\"><cite>Evening Star</cite></a> as the largest daily in the capital city, both of them recording a circulation of over 40,000. The politically Democratic <cite>Evening Times</cite> covered local stories as well as foreign news culled from wire services. It often featured a society or crime article on the front page and included a daily weather map, sports, gossip, women's news, and news of sundry federal agencies and the activities of civil servants. Beginning in 1901 the newspaper also published fiction, Sunday comics, and true adventure stories. That year, advertising moved to the forefront, often appearing prominently on the front page.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The newspaper claimed to have the timeliest coverage of national elections and foreign news reports. Local issues dominate the news beyond the first page, but sports and business news were also featured. The<cite> Times</cite> reported heavily on the changing landscape in Washington at the turn of the twentieth century, with frequent stories on city planning and urbanization activities, the development of the national Mall, alley and tenement reform, sanitary improvements, road building and repairs.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">William Randolph Hearst gained control of the <cite>Times</cite> in 1917 through his agent Arthur Brisbane and five years later merged it with the newly acquired <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433\"><cite>Washington Herald</cite></a>.  A combined Sunday edition of both papers was published as the <cite>Washington Times-Herald</cite> in 1922 and 1923, and then a combined Sunday edition was published as the <cite>Washington Herald</cite> until 1937. A combined daily and Sunday edition, called the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85040694\"><cite>Washington Times-Herald</cite></a>, began publication February 1, 1939.

In 1885, The<em>Evening Critic </em>became the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82000205/\"><em>Washington Critic</em></a>, to reflect the paper\u2019s \u201clocal habitation.\u201d The <em>Critic</em> remained \u201cessentially a Washington paper\u2014devoted to Washington affairs, freighted with Washington news, an exponent and advocate of Washington interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1888 the<em> Critic, </em>along with the<a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014727/\"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em>, </em>was bought by a wealthy investor, and the two papers entered into a short-lived partnership through which the<em>Critic </em>appeared as an evening edition of the<em>Post. </em>\u00a0\u00a0From 1889 to 1891, the<em> Critic </em>went through a turbulent period, shifting its management and adopting six different titles. In 1889 alone, the<em>Critic </em>was published under three different consecutive titles: the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014422/\"><em>Capital and Critic</em></a><em>,</em> the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014420/\">Evening Capital and Critic</a></em><em>,</em> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88063022/\"><em>Evening Capital</em></a>.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBy 1890, the paper had again come under new management and for the last time adopted the well-worn title, the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058169/\">Washington Critic</a></em>.\u00a0 In its first edition<em>, </em>the paper promised to provide Washingtonians with concise and objective reporting. The <em>Critic </em>claimed that it was \u201cyoked to no particular interest, to no official set, to no private scheme\u2026[it] will try to give its readers the happenings of the world, in condensed form, from day to day, reserving most of its space for and devoting the major part of its labor to, the affairs of Washington, which, after all, is at once its parent and its prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the beginning and end of both its aim and ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOver the next year, the title of the paper changed twice, first to the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058170/\"><em>Daily Critic</em></a>\u00a0 and then to the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn2008058171/\"><em>Critic</em></a><em>, </em>the later change being \u201cbest suited to the scheme we have adopted\u2014that of compactness and condensation in presenting the news.\u201d In 1891, the paper entered its final period appearing as the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062228/\">Critic and Record\u00a0</a></em> and publishing its last issue in May 1896.</p>\n"

        "\n<p>\r\n\tThe Grays Harbor timber region, including the towns of Aberdeen, Hoquiam, and Cosmopolis, was a hotbed of radical labor activity early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Workers endured long hours, low pay, and frequent injuries, many fatal, making them receptive to organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the Socialist Party of America. These organizations advocated more far-reaching social changes than those promoted by traditional trade unions, represented by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) nationally and the Washington State Federation of Labor at the state level. IWW members were central to the November 1911 to January 1912 fight against an Aberdeen ordinance severely curtailing street speaking, and a Grays Harbor lumber strike from March to May 1912. Members of the more conservative AFL-affiliated local unions were represented on both sides during these fights; some supported the striking workers while others sided with authorities and mill operators, a few even aiding efforts to intimidate or deport IWW members and strikers.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs early as July 1912, an AFL affiliated labor paper, the <em>Hoquiam Free Press</em>, was publishing on Grays Harbor. By 1915, the <em>Southwest Washington Labor Press</em> was the representative paper for AFL affiliated trade unionists in the area. Copies of the <em>Southwest Washington Labor Press</em> and its predecessors during these turbulent early years are sadly unavailable to shed light on what stance the paper may have taken on the conflicts that so closely preceded its birth.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Southwest Washington Labor Press</em> consisted largely of syndicated columns from the International Labor News Service with contributions from the managing editors and the board of directors. Editorship of the <em>Press</em> passed between several union newspaper men, including from Alfred E. Wolters to Louis Calvin Hinman on May 23, 1924, and to Jesse H. Godfrey with the September 4, 1925 issue. The board was a mix of representatives from the Aberdeen and Hoquiam local labor councils. The colophon boasted the <em>Press</em> was \"Owned and controlled by Organized Labor. Official Organ of Aberdeen Central Labor Council, Hoquiam Trades and Labor Council and the Washington State Federation of Labor.\"</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPublished weekly on Fridays, each issue consisted of local and international stories, entertainment news, and health advice, and they usually included a cartoon and an infographic related to the news of the week or to seasonal changes to the labor landscape. Editorials published under the section headers \"By the Way\" and \"The Cherry Tree\" appeared intermittently throughout the mid-1920s. \"By the Way\" was first published February 22, 1924 with the caption \"comment and criticism about things doing in the world.\" The section featured multiple short pieces on varying topics, including the unfolding Teapot Dome scandal, the Communist Party (which the paper opposed), child labor conditions, and the lack of African American representation in textbooks. \"By the Way\" even reports of the Navy shooting whales, concluding \"there are plenty of means of affording warships target practice without killing helpless monsters of the deep.\" Appearing a few years later, \"The Cherry Tree\" featured longer discussions on a single topic, ranging from conscription of capital and labor during wartime, to the importance of wages for workers commensurate with the wealth they create, to realism in art and entertainment.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrom efforts to pass an anti-child labor amendment to court cases about prison labor and prisoner leasing, the national labor agenda presented in the \u200b<em>Press</em>\u200b focused on the institutions of organized labor and their fight with the institutions of capital. Locally, support for the typographical workers, stereotypers, electrotypers, and mailers of the William Randolph Hearst owned <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045605/\"><em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em></a>\u200b (<em>P-I</em>) appeared on the pages of the <em>Press</em>\u200b during contentious negotiations with the paper's owners in 1924 and 1925. In keeping with the AFL's support of public power on the national level, the paper backed the Wynooche [<em>sic</em>] Power Project for the creation of an Aberdeen municipal power system. The \u200b<em>Press</em> \u200btook the stance that a local utility project would support the growing population of Grays Harbor County; the editorial argued that funding it by selling bonds would put the power, very literally, in the hands of the people. Voters approved the project in a June 29, 1926 special election.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe influence of labor-conscious engagement in local economies carried through to the advertisements and classifieds. Each week, with the assurance that \"the merchants whose advertisements appear in our columns are wide-awake, progressive business men entitled to your support,\" the \u200b<em>Press</em> \u200bdevoted ample page space to ads. This included a full page \"Hoquiam-Aberdeen Classified Directory Labor's Friends\" with a list of labor-friendly businesses, contact information for specific labor unions, and prominent \"Do Not Patronize\" lists compiled by the Aberdeen and Hoquiam councils. The guarantee also covered political ads, as demonstrated by those for local elections in the latter half of 1926.</p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\nThe <cite>Washington Weekly Post</cite> was first published on August 8, 1878, roughly a year after the establishment of its parent newspaper, the daily <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014727\"><cite>Washington Post</cite></a>. This 5-page weekly was printed on Tuesdays and amassed features from the daily edition for a national audience. It eventually surpassed the daily in sales with a circulation of 35,000 by 1885. Like the daily, the <cite>Weekly Post</cite> was under the editorial direction of publisher Stilson Hutchins and printed from the <cite>Washington Post</cite> building at 914 Pennsylvania Avenue. The pages digitized here, however, represent a later era of the paper after its purchase by Frank Hatton and Beriah Wilkins in 1889. In its early years, the paper was 26 x 39 inches and cost $7.50 annually, but it eventually settled into a 16 x 24 inch format with an annual subscription of $1.00. </p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">As a national paper, the <cite>Weekly Post</cite> focused mainly on foreign affairs and major domestic politics. The pages often emphasized its owners' conservative views with editorials on such issues as states' rights, diplomacy, and foreign imperialism. The selection digitized here contains much coverage and opinion on newly acquired American lands in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, the Boer War in South Africa, the Boxer Rebellion in China, and domestic news in national politics. Beyond the front page, the weekly also frequently included a page on local news from Virginia and the Carolinas, and a round-up of recent happenings in the U.S Congress. Occasionally, it would include more special-interest pages on fashion and beauty, weather and market reports, travel writing, and fiction.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The fate of the <cite>Weekly Post</cite> is unknown and no libraries are known to have issues past the ones available here. The Tuesday weekly did have to share its title as the <cite>Washington Post's</cite> weekly edition with the <cite>Sunday Post</cite>, established in 1880. The Sunday edition, the first of its kind in Washington, grew from eight pages in 1885 to 36 pages in 1904 and its similar content and audience may have contributed to the <cite>Weekly Post's</cite> decline.   \n                              </p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tAccording to his memoirs, Miller Freeman had only $3.00 and a bicycle when he decided to start his own newspaper, the <cite>Ranche and Range</cite>, in North Yakima in 1897. At the age of 21, Miller was the last of his siblings to leave the shadow of his father, Legh Freeman, who had published numerous small papers while moving west with his family. Miller had learned printing while working on the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022156/\"><cite>Frontier Index</cite></a> (also known as the \"Press on Wheels,\" which was published in various locations throughout the West) and most recently on the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95062809/\"><cite>Washington Farmer</cite></a> in Yakima. When Legh refused to pay his son for his work, Miller decided to leave the family enterprise and start his own newspaper.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThough the <cite>Washington Farmer</cite> was ostensibly an agricultural journal, Legh Freeman had employed it as a political organ supporting William Jennings Bryan. Young Miller, who had witnessed the struggle to found the state agricultural college, saw the need for a publication devoted exclusively to the scientific advancement of agricultural practice. He also decided to keep the new <cite>Ranche and Range</cite> apolitical. Miller arranged to print the paper on the press of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085525/\"><cite>Yakima Republic</cite></a> when it was idle. The <cite>Ranche and Range</cite> made a profit, and Miller promptly moved its editorial office from North Yakima to Seattle and opened a business office in Spokane.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tIn 1902, Miller Freeman changed the name of the <cite>Ranche and Range</cite> to the <cite>Ranch</cite>, which he published in Seattle. The following year, he also founded another paper in Seattle called the <cite>Pacific Fisherman</cite>. Freeman sold the <cite>Ranch</cite> to Leonard Fowler of Wenatchee in 1908, and it was subsequently sold to J. D. Dean of Kent, Washington. However, a discussion with a business colleague led Freeman to reconsider this decision and to launch a regional agricultural paper franchise. Consequently, he bought back the <cite>Ranch</cite> in 1914 and renamed it the <cite>Washington Farmer</cite>. Freeman also purchased the <cite>Oregon Agriculturalist</cite> and the <cite>Gem State Rural</cite>, renaming them the <cite>Oregon Farmer</cite> and the <cite>Idaho Farmer</cite> respectively. Managing three agricultural papers proved onerous, and Freeman soon decided to concentrate on his industrial papers. In 1915, Freeman sold the <cite>Washington Farmer</cite> and the other two agricultural papers to the Spokane publisher of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024754/\"><cite>Spokesman Review</cite></a>. The <cite>Washington Farmer</cite> remained in publication until 1971.</p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tHorace Greeley founded the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a> as a Whig party, penny paper on April 10, 1841, and would continue as its editor for the next thirty years. During Greeley's tenure the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the more significant newspapers in the United States, and Greeley was known as the outstanding newspaper editor of his time. In 1924 the <cite>Tribune</cite> merged with the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, a publication which would remain a major United States daily until its demise.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tDistinguishing features of the early penny press were their inexpensiveness, their appeal to the average reader, their coverage of more and different types of news, and, in some instances, a marked political independence. Penny papers such as the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> were known for their emphasis on lurid crime reporting and humorous, human interest stories from the police court. The <cite>Tribune</cite> offered a strong moralistic flavor, however, playing down crime reports and scandals, providing political news, special articles, lectures, book reviews, book excerpts and poetry. As with other penny papers, the <cite>Tribune</cite> was not averse to building circulation by carrying accounts involving sex and crime, but it was careful to present this material under the guise of cautionary tales.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley gathered an impressive array of editors and feature writers, among them Henry J. Raymond, Charles A. Dana, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and, for a while, Karl Marx served as his London correspondent. Reflecting his puritanical upbringing, Greeley opposed liquor, tobacco, gambling, prostitution, and capital punishment, while actively promoting the anti-slavery cause. His editorial columns urged a variety of educational reforms and favored producer's cooperatives, but opposed women's suffrage. He popularized the phrase \"Go west, young man; go west!\" The <cite>Tribune</cite> supported Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but opposed his renomination in 1864.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tWhile the <cite>Tribune's</cite> circulation always trailed its rivals the <cite>Sun</cite> and the <cite>Herald</cite>, neither could match the immense success of its weekly edition. First published on September 2, 1841, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030280/\"><cite>Tribune weekly</cite></a> enjoyed a wide popularity in small cities and towns, and by 1860 had registered a record-breaking circulation of 200,000.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley died in 1872. Under Whitelaw Reid's control (1873-1912), the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the nation's leading Republican dailies. Reid's son, Ogden, succeeded him and purchased the <cite>New York Herald</cite> in 1924, merging the two newspapers to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>. Noted for its typographical excellence, the high quality of its writing, its Washington and foreign reporting, and its political columnists, the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> would reign as the voice of moderate Republicanism and competent journalism for the next four decades. It featured some of the best reporters in the business-Joseph Barnes, Homer Bigart, Russell Hill, Joseph Driscoll, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe-and top drawer political columnists such as Walter Lippman, David Lawrence, Joseph Alsop, and Roscoe Drummond. Following Ogden Reid's death in 1947, the paper began a steady decline, undergoing numerous financial setbacks. In 1961 media entrepreneur John Hay (\"Jock\") Whitney became majority shareholder, publisher and editor-in-chief, investing $40 million in a vain attempt to save the paper. The newspaper's last issue as the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> was published April 24, 1966. It merged with two other struggling New York papers, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86071604/\"><cite>Journal American</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030207/\"><cite>World Telegram and the Sun</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030209/\"><cite>World Journal Tribune</cite></a>, which began publishing September 12, 1966 after a lengthy strike. It ceased publication May 5, 1967.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tSee also: <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1841-April 12, 1842; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/\"><cite>New York Daily Tribune</cite></a>, April 22, 1842-May 1, 1850 and May 13, 1850-April 9 1866; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1866-March 18, 1924; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald, New York Tribune</cite></a>, March 19, 1924-May 30, 1926; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030216/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, May 31, 1926-April 24, 1966.</p>\n"

        "\n<p>\r\n\tFounded in December of 1845 by Amor J. Williamson and William Burns, the New York City <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030362/\"><em>Sunday Dispatch</em></a> ran from 1845-1854, later becoming the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030364/\"><em>New-York Dispatch</em></a> from 1854-1861, then <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026213/\"><em>Sunday Dispatch</em></a> from 1861-1863, and finally the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026214/\"><em>New York Dispatch</em></a> from 1863 onwards. The <em>Dispatch</em> was part of \"a new class of newspapers---partly literary, partly gossiping, partly silly ... the Sunday Newspaper press\" as defined by <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a> on July 29, 1844. Due to taboos around Sunday activities, newspapers publishing on Sundays only began to thrive in New York City in the 1840s. While its circulation figures were hotly contested in its early years, the <em>Dispatch</em> attested that it had an average issue circulation of 28,442 in 1855, giving it the third highest per-issue circulation in New York City. (In that year, the major New York City newspapers competed for a Post Office contract for the \"advertisement of Uncalled-for Letters\" and had to provide proof of circulation. This competition was a mismatch as the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> was a weekly, and the three other competing newspapers were dailies: <em><a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\">The Sun</a></em>, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a>, and <em>the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030746/\">New York Daily Times</a></em>. The contract was ultimately awarded to <em>The New York Herald</em>. Its subscriber base never really grew, however, and its circulation was estimated in the 20-25,000 range from 1869 through the 1880s.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs a literary paper, the <em>Dispatch</em> included arts criticism, fiction, and poetry. During the late 1840s to early 1850s, Walt Whitman published several pieces in the paper, ranging from fiction to art criticism. These items were published under various signatures, from his full name to pseudonyms such as \"Paumanok,\" to no signature at all. \"The Life and Adventures of Jack Engle,\" a serialized novel rediscovered in 2016, was published unsigned in 1852. In keeping with the paper's literary ambitions, the advertisements had a particular flair: \"If you are enticed by evil doers and more especially if you're tempted by your own passions to pursue a course of profligacy ... go up into the Anatomical Museum!\" The paper also had a notable focus on \"Masonic Matters,\" with a column starting in 1859 that became a full page in later editions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Dispatch</em> did not shy away from politics or lawsuits. Initially a Whig and later a Republican, the publisher Amor Williamson was elected as an alderman and then as tax commissioner in the 1850s. In 1858 and 1860, he lost two Congressional races; the first was a contentious battle against Tammany Hall-backed Democrat Daniel Sickles. Williamson was also sued by a ferry company in 1849 and by James Gordon Bennett, founder of <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a>, for libel in 1848 for calling his <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030101/\"><em>Sunday Courier</em></a> a failure.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor most of its publication, the <em>Dispatch</em> operated as a family business. After Amor Williamson died in 1867, his wife Mary A. Williamson ran the publication profitably until her death in 1878. A New York Supreme Court case estimated the annual income under her tenure as more than $10,000 per year, which would be more than $200,000 in 2022 dollars. The Williamson sons took over after her death. Mismanagement in the 1880s led to a rapid decline in circulation in the 1890s, and the paper likely folded in 1899.</p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> debuted on September 3, 1833, becoming the first successful penny daily, popular with the city\u2019s less affluent, working classes. Its publisher, Benjamin H. Day, emphasized local events, police court reports, and sports in his four-page morning newspaper. Advertisements, notably help-wanted ads, were plentiful. By 1834, the <cite>Sun</cite> had the largest circulation in the United States. Its rising popularity was attributed to its readers\u2019 passion for the <cite>Sun</cite>'s sensational and sometimes fabricated stories and the paper\u2019s exaggerated coverage of sundry scandals. Its success was also the result of the efforts of the city\u2019s ubiquitous newsboys, who the innovative Day had hired to hawk the paper. The <cite>Sun</cite> added a Saturday edition in 1836.\u00a0 A number of weekly and semiweekly titles were also published, such as the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026223/\">Weekly Sun</a></em> (1851-69), which shares the same masthead as the <em>Sun</em> with \"Weekly\" appearing in the title ornament.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe paper\u2019s true glory days began in 1868 when Charles A. Dana, former managing editor of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, became part owner and editor. Dana endeavored to apply the art of literary craftsmanship to the news. Under him, the <cite>Sun</cite> became known as \u201cthe newspaperman\u2019s newspaper,\u201d featuring editorials, society news, and human-interest stories. A Sunday edition was added in 1875 and, later, a Saturday supplement appeared, offering book notices, essays, and fictional sketches by Bret Harte, Henry James, and other well-known writers. In the 1880s, the paper\u2019s size increased to eight pages and in 1887 the <cite>Evening Sun</cite> hit the streets in two editions: <cite>Wall Street</cite> and <cite>Night</cite></p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tOn September 21, 1897, in response to a letter from eight-year-old reader Virginia O'Hanlon (\u201cPapa says \u2018If you see it in <cite>The Sun</cite> it\u2019s so.\u2019 Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?\u201d), the paper published \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\u201d This opinion piece by veteran newspaperman Francis P. Church, insisting that Santa Claus \u201cexists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist,\u201d caused an immediate sensation. It became one of the most famous editorials in newspaper publishing history; the <cite>Sun</cite> would reprint this editorial annually until 1949.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBy 1910 the paper averaged some 15 pages, with Sunday editions triple that length. In 1916 entrepreneur Frank A. Munsey, owner of multiple other newspapers, purchased the <cite>Sun</cite>, and a series of mergers followed. In July 1916, the <em>Sun</em> briefly became the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030430/\">Sun and New York Press</a></em> and then reverted to the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/\">Sun</a></em> by the end of the month. In 1920, the\u00a0<em>Sun\u00a0</em>merged with\u00a0the\u00a0<em>New York Herald</em>,\u00a0and the titles were combined to create\u00a0<em>the Sun\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0New York Herald</em>\u00a0which appeared daily from February\u00a0to September of 1920.\u00a0In October 1920, the daily was split into the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/\">New York Herald</a></em>\u00a0and\u00a0the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030274/\">Sun</a>,\u00a0</em>absorbing\u00a0the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030428/\">Evening Sun</a></em>\u00a0in the process. \u00a0The\u00a0<em>Sun</em>\u00a0continued until January 5, 1950, when it merged with the\u00a0<em>New York World-Telegram\u00a0</em>and became the\u00a0<em>New York World-Telegram and the Sun</em>. In 1966 that title became part of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030209/\"><cite>World Journal Tribune</cite></a>; the latter folded the following year.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe <cite>Sun</cite> morgue of clipped newspaper articles is held by the Humanities and Social Sciences Library of the New York Public Library. The Library of Congress Prints and Photograph Division holds an estimated one million photographs, which were assembled by the <cite>Sun</cite> and subsequent papers between the 1890s and 1967, in the <cite>New York World-Telegram</cite> and the <cite>Sun</cite> Newspaper Photograph Collection.</p>\n"

        "\n<p>\r\n\tFounded in December of 1845 by Amor J. Williamson and William Burns, the New York City <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030362/\"><em>Sunday Dispatch</em></a> ran from 1845-1854, later becoming the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030364/\"><em>New-York Dispatch</em></a> from 1854-1861, then <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026213/\"><em>Sunday Dispatch</em></a> from 1861-1863, and finally the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026214/\"><em>New York Dispatch</em></a> from 1863 onwards. The <em>Dispatch</em> was part of \"a new class of newspapers---partly literary, partly gossiping, partly silly ... the Sunday Newspaper press\" as defined by <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a> on July 29, 1844. Due to taboos around Sunday activities, newspapers publishing on Sundays only began to thrive in New York City in the 1840s. While its circulation figures were hotly contested in its early years, the <em>Dispatch</em> attested that it had an average issue circulation of 28,442 in 1855, giving it the third highest per-issue circulation in New York City. (In that year, the major New York City newspapers competed for a Post Office contract for the \"advertisement of Uncalled-for Letters\" and had to provide proof of circulation. This competition was a mismatch as the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> was a weekly, and the three other competing newspapers were dailies: <em><a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\">The Sun</a></em>, <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a>, and <em>the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030746/\">New York Daily Times</a></em>. The contract was ultimately awarded to <em>The New York Herald</em>. Its subscriber base never really grew, however, and its circulation was estimated in the 20-25,000 range from 1869 through the 1880s.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAs a literary paper, the <em>Dispatch</em> included arts criticism, fiction, and poetry. During the late 1840s to early 1850s, Walt Whitman published several pieces in the paper, ranging from fiction to art criticism. These items were published under various signatures, from his full name to pseudonyms such as \"Paumanok,\" to no signature at all. \"The Life and Adventures of Jack Engle,\" a serialized novel rediscovered in 2016, was published unsigned in 1852. In keeping with the paper's literary ambitions, the advertisements had a particular flair: \"If you are enticed by evil doers and more especially if you're tempted by your own passions to pursue a course of profligacy ... go up into the Anatomical Museum!\" The paper also had a notable focus on \"Masonic Matters,\" with a column starting in 1859 that became a full page in later editions.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Dispatch</em> did not shy away from politics or lawsuits. Initially a Whig and later a Republican, the publisher Amor Williamson was elected as an alderman and then as tax commissioner in the 1850s. In 1858 and 1860, he lost two Congressional races; the first was a contentious battle against Tammany Hall-backed Democrat Daniel Sickles. Williamson was also sued by a ferry company in 1849 and by James Gordon Bennett, founder of <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><em>The New York Herald</em></a>, for libel in 1848 for calling his <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030101/\"><em>Sunday Courier</em></a> a failure.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor most of its publication, the <em>Dispatch</em> operated as a family business. After Amor Williamson died in 1867, his wife Mary A. Williamson ran the publication profitably until her death in 1878. A New York Supreme Court case estimated the annual income under her tenure as more than $10,000 per year, which would be more than $200,000 in 2022 dollars. The Williamson sons took over after her death. Mismanagement in the 1880s led to a rapid decline in circulation in the 1890s, and the paper likely folded in 1899.</p>\n"

Its publisher, Benjamin H. Day, emphasized local events, police court reports, and sports in his four-page morning newspaper. Advertisements, notably help-wanted ads, were plentiful. By 1834, the <cite>Sun</cite> had the largest circulation in the United States. Its rising popularity was attributed to its readers\u2019 passion for the <cite>Sun</cite>'s sensational and sometimes fabricated stories and the paper\u2019s exaggerated coverage of sundry scandals. Its success was also the result of the efforts of the city\u2019s ubiquitous newsboys, who the innovative Day had hired to hawk the paper. The <cite>Sun</cite> added a Saturday edition in 1836.\u00a0 A number of weekly and semiweekly titles were also published, such as the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026223/\">Weekly Sun</a></em> (1851-69), which shares the same masthead as the <em>Sun</em> with \"Weekly\" appearing in the title ornament.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe paper\u2019s true glory days began in 1868 when Charles A.

Under him, the <cite>Sun</cite> became known as \u201cthe newspaperman\u2019s newspaper,\u201d featuring editorials, society news, and human-interest stories. A Sunday edition was added in 1875 and, later, a Saturday supplement appeared, offering book notices, essays, and fictional sketches by Bret Harte, Henry James, and other well-known writers. In the 1880s, the paper\u2019s size increased to eight pages and in 1887 the <cite>Evening Sun</cite> hit the streets in two editions: <cite>Wall Street</cite> and <cite>Night</cite></p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tOn September 21, 1897, in response to a letter from eight-year-old reader Virginia O'Hanlon (\u201cPapa says \u2018If you see it in <cite>The Sun</cite> it\u2019s so.\u2019 Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?\u201d), the paper published \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\u201d This opinion piece by veteran newspaperman Francis P.

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> debuted on September 3, 1833, becoming the first successful penny daily, popular with the city\u2019s less affluent, working classes. Its publisher, Benjamin H. Day, emphasized local events, police court reports, and sports in his four-page morning newspaper. Advertisements, notably help-wanted ads, were plentiful. By 1834, the <cite>Sun</cite> had the largest circulation in the United States. Its rising popularity was attributed to its readers\u2019 passion for the <cite>Sun</cite>'s sensational and sometimes fabricated stories and the paper\u2019s exaggerated coverage of sundry scandals. Its success was also the result of the efforts of the city\u2019s ubiquitous newsboys, who the innovative Day had hired to hawk the paper. The <cite>Sun</cite> added a Saturday edition in 1836.\u00a0 A number of weekly and semiweekly titles were also published, such as the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85026223/\">Weekly Sun</a></em> (1851-69), which shares the same masthead as the <em>Sun</em> with \"Weekly\" appearing in the title ornament.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe paper\u2019s true glory days began in 1868 when Charles A. Dana, former managing editor of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, became part owner and editor. Dana endeavored to apply the art of literary craftsmanship to the news. Under him, the <cite>Sun</cite> became known as \u201cthe newspaperman\u2019s newspaper,\u201d featuring editorials, society news, and human-interest stories. A Sunday edition was added in 1875 and, later, a Saturday supplement appeared, offering book notices, essays, and fictional sketches by Bret Harte, Henry James, and other well-known writers. In the 1880s, the paper\u2019s size increased to eight pages and in 1887 the <cite>Evening Sun</cite> hit the streets in two editions: <cite>Wall Street</cite> and <cite>Night</cite></p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tOn September 21, 1897, in response to a letter from eight-year-old reader Virginia O'Hanlon (\u201cPapa says \u2018If you see it in <cite>The Sun</cite> it\u2019s so.\u2019 Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?\u201d), the paper published \u201cYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\u201d This opinion piece by veteran newspaperman Francis P. Church, insisting that Santa Claus \u201cexists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist,\u201d caused an immediate sensation. It became one of the most famous editorials in newspaper publishing history; the <cite>Sun</cite> would reprint this editorial annually until 1949.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBy 1910 the paper averaged some 15 pages, with Sunday editions triple that length. In 1916 entrepreneur Frank A. Munsey, owner of multiple other newspapers, purchased the <cite>Sun</cite>, and a series of mergers followed. In July 1916, the <em>Sun</em> briefly became the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030430/\">Sun and New York Press</a></em> and then reverted to the <em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/\">Sun</a></em> by the end of the month. In 1920, the\u00a0<em>Sun\u00a0</em>merged with\u00a0the\u00a0<em>New York Herald</em>,\u00a0and the titles were combined to create\u00a0<em>the Sun\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0New York Herald</em>\u00a0which appeared daily from February\u00a0to September of 1920.\u00a0In October 1920, the daily was split into the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/\">New York Herald</a></em>\u00a0and\u00a0the<em> <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030274/\">Sun</a>,\u00a0</em>absorbing\u00a0the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030428/\">Evening Sun</a></em>\u00a0in the process. \u00a0The\u00a0<em>Sun</em>\u00a0continued until January 5, 1950, when it merged with the\u00a0<em>New York World-Telegram\u00a0</em>and became the\u00a0<em>New York World-Telegram and the Sun</em>. In 1966 that title became part of the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030209/\"><cite>World Journal Tribune</cite></a>; the latter folded the following year.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tThe <cite>Sun</cite> morgue of clipped newspaper articles is held by the Humanities and Social Sciences Library of the New York Public Library. The Library of Congress Prints and Photograph Division holds an estimated one million photographs, which were assembled by the <cite>Sun</cite> and subsequent papers between the 1890s and 1967, in the <cite>New York World-Telegram</cite> and the <cite>Sun</cite> Newspaper Photograph Collection.</p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tHorace Greeley founded the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a> as a Whig party, penny paper on April 10, 1841, and would continue as its editor for the next thirty years. During Greeley's tenure the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the more significant newspapers in the United States, and Greeley was known as the outstanding newspaper editor of his time. In 1924 the <cite>Tribune</cite> merged with the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, a publication which would remain a major United States daily until its demise.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tDistinguishing features of the early penny press were their inexpensiveness, their appeal to the average reader, their coverage of more and different types of news, and, in some instances, a marked political independence. Penny papers such as the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> were known for their emphasis on lurid crime reporting and humorous, human interest stories from the police court. The <cite>Tribune</cite> offered a strong moralistic flavor, however, playing down crime reports and scandals, providing political news, special articles, lectures, book reviews, book excerpts and poetry. As with other penny papers, the <cite>Tribune</cite> was not averse to building circulation by carrying accounts involving sex and crime, but it was careful to present this material under the guise of cautionary tales.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley gathered an impressive array of editors and feature writers, among them Henry J. Raymond, Charles A. Dana, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and, for a while, Karl Marx served as his London correspondent. Reflecting his puritanical upbringing, Greeley opposed liquor, tobacco, gambling, prostitution, and capital punishment, while actively promoting the anti-slavery cause. His editorial columns urged a variety of educational reforms and favored producer's cooperatives, but opposed women's suffrage. He popularized the phrase \"Go west, young man; go west!\" The <cite>Tribune</cite> supported Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but opposed his renomination in 1864.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tWhile the <cite>Tribune's</cite> circulation always trailed its rivals the <cite>Sun</cite> and the <cite>Herald</cite>, neither could match the immense success of its weekly edition. First published on September 2, 1841, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030280/\"><cite>Tribune weekly</cite></a> enjoyed a wide popularity in small cities and towns, and by 1860 had registered a record-breaking circulation of 200,000.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley died in 1872. Under Whitelaw Reid's control (1873-1912), the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the nation's leading Republican dailies. Reid's son, Ogden, succeeded him and purchased the <cite>New York Herald</cite> in 1924, merging the two newspapers to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>. Noted for its typographical excellence, the high quality of its writing, its Washington and foreign reporting, and its political columnists, the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> would reign as the voice of moderate Republicanism and competent journalism for the next four decades. It featured some of the best reporters in the business-Joseph Barnes, Homer Bigart, Russell Hill, Joseph Driscoll, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe-and top drawer political columnists such as Walter Lippman, David Lawrence, Joseph Alsop, and Roscoe Drummond. Following Ogden Reid's death in 1947, the paper began a steady decline, undergoing numerous financial setbacks. In 1961 media entrepreneur John Hay (\"Jock\") Whitney became majority shareholder, publisher and editor-in-chief, investing $40 million in a vain attempt to save the paper. The newspaper's last issue as the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> was published April 24, 1966. It merged with two other struggling New York papers, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86071604/\"><cite>Journal American</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030207/\"><cite>World Telegram and the Sun</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030209/\"><cite>World Journal Tribune</cite></a>, which began publishing September 12, 1966 after a lengthy strike. It ceased publication May 5, 1967.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tSee also: <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1841-April 12, 1842; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/\"><cite>New York Daily Tribune</cite></a>, April 22, 1842-May 1, 1850 and May 13, 1850-April 9 1866; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1866-March 18, 1924; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald, New York Tribune</cite></a>, March 19, 1924-May 30, 1926; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030216/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, May 31, 1926-April 24, 1966.</p>\n"

        "\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tHorace Greeley founded the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a> as a Whig party, penny paper on April 10, 1841, and would continue as its editor for the next thirty years. During Greeley's tenure the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the more significant newspapers in the United States, and Greeley was known as the outstanding newspaper editor of his time. In 1924 the <cite>Tribune</cite> merged with the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045774/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, a publication which would remain a major United States daily until its demise.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tDistinguishing features of the early penny press were their inexpensiveness, their appeal to the average reader, their coverage of more and different types of news, and, in some instances, a marked political independence. Penny papers such as the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/\"><cite>New York Sun</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/\"><cite>New York Herald</cite></a> were known for their emphasis on lurid crime reporting and humorous, human interest stories from the police court. The <cite>Tribune</cite> offered a strong moralistic flavor, however, playing down crime reports and scandals, providing political news, special articles, lectures, book reviews, book excerpts and poetry. As with other penny papers, the <cite>Tribune</cite> was not averse to building circulation by carrying accounts involving sex and crime, but it was careful to present this material under the guise of cautionary tales.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley gathered an impressive array of editors and feature writers, among them Henry J. Raymond, Charles A. Dana, Bayard Taylor, George Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and, for a while, Karl Marx served as his London correspondent. Reflecting his puritanical upbringing, Greeley opposed liquor, tobacco, gambling, prostitution, and capital punishment, while actively promoting the anti-slavery cause. His editorial columns urged a variety of educational reforms and favored producer's cooperatives, but opposed women's suffrage. He popularized the phrase \"Go west, young man; go west!\" The <cite>Tribune</cite> supported Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, but opposed his renomination in 1864.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tWhile the <cite>Tribune's</cite> circulation always trailed its rivals the <cite>Sun</cite> and the <cite>Herald</cite>, neither could match the immense success of its weekly edition. First published on September 2, 1841, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030280/\"><cite>Tribune weekly</cite></a> enjoyed a wide popularity in small cities and towns, and by 1860 had registered a record-breaking circulation of 200,000.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tGreeley died in 1872. Under Whitelaw Reid's control (1873-1912), the <cite>Tribune</cite> became one of the nation's leading Republican dailies. Reid's son, Ogden, succeeded him and purchased the <cite>New York Herald</cite> in 1924, merging the two newspapers to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>. Noted for its typographical excellence, the high quality of its writing, its Washington and foreign reporting, and its political columnists, the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> would reign as the voice of moderate Republicanism and competent journalism for the next four decades. It featured some of the best reporters in the business-Joseph Barnes, Homer Bigart, Russell Hill, Joseph Driscoll, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe-and top drawer political columnists such as Walter Lippman, David Lawrence, Joseph Alsop, and Roscoe Drummond. Following Ogden Reid's death in 1947, the paper began a steady decline, undergoing numerous financial setbacks. In 1961 media entrepreneur John Hay (\"Jock\") Whitney became majority shareholder, publisher and editor-in-chief, investing $40 million in a vain attempt to save the paper. The newspaper's last issue as the <cite>Herald Tribune</cite> was published April 24, 1966. It merged with two other struggling New York papers, the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86071604/\"><cite>Journal American</cite></a> and the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030207/\"><cite>World Telegram and the Sun</cite></a> to form the <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030209/\"><cite>World Journal Tribune</cite></a>, which began publishing September 12, 1966 after a lengthy strike. It ceased publication May 5, 1967.</p>\n<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n\tSee also: <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030212/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1841-April 12, 1842; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030213/\"><cite>New York Daily Tribune</cite></a>, April 22, 1842-May 1, 1850 and May 13, 1850-April 9 1866; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/\"><cite>New York Tribune</cite></a>, April 10, 1866-March 18, 1924; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030215/\"><cite>New York Herald, New York Tribune</cite></a>, March 19, 1924-May 30, 1926; <a href=\"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030216/\"><cite>New York Herald Tribune</cite></a>, May 31, 1926-April 24, 1966.</p>\n"
