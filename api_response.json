Electricity\nis in the blood, the brain, the nerves : it flows throughout the\nbody and is that warm force given oy Nature. To replenish this\npower when lost by disease is the work of my new and scientific\napplication. In this way I promote circulation and nerve action,\ndrive out pain and completely cure your ailment. For Rheuma\ntism, Lumbago, Weakness of all kinds. Varicocele, Drains, etc.,\nthere is no remedy at all comparable with it.\nNY BEITS DO NOT BURN ANYONE\nFor more than ten years 1 have been using an extra special\ncovering for my discs, so arranged that the same may be worn on\nthe body with or without this covering, at the option of the\nwearer. Other advertisers claiming that they alone furnish such\ncovers with their Belts, simply print falsehoods.\nBUY NO BEITS\nWhich require immersion in strong vinegar or other acids for\ncharging purposes. Such belts last the wearer less than a month.\nAll my Belts carry a special guarantee with them for their lasting\nqualities, and any repairs needed occasionally are made free of\ncharge.\nTHIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE PUBLIC\nConstantly, as my Dr. Sanden Belts, with attachments, have\nbeen, ought to be enough evidence to sufferers that dealing with\nme they run no chances of dangerous experiments. Is it not\nbetter to use my Belt, under my own experienced advice, than to\nuse that of some other person whose name you never heard of a\nyear or so ago ?\nAt least all owe it to themselves to examine my Belts and\nappliances before purchasing those of other makes. I will acco\nmodate anyone to make this examination of my Belts at their\nown homes if they will but ask it.\nCall tr Write for my \"THREE CLASSES OF HEN.\"\nSANDEN ELECTRIC CO.,\n167 Fourth St., Russel Building, Portland, Or.\nSeattle Branch, Room 409 Washington Bnlldlni.\nSINS OF THE FATHER.\nMb Oh* Ml Thin Is a true statement of a nitMl\nHD vD* lyn law.

A strong\nand numerous lobby of representatives of\nEastern publishing houses have been In\nthe state for several weeks past and are\nnow in this city. The local publishers\nalso are on the ground, and are aided by\nfriends working in the interest of the\nbooks of the Westland Publishing Com\npany, the corporation formed recently nnd\ncomposed of publishers of Seattle, Tacoma\nand Olympia. Rupt. Brown says he Is in\nreceipt of many letters from school men\nearning him to keep a watchful eye and\nnot to select inferior books because they\nhappen to be presented by local publishers,\nand In this eorineQtion he has given as\nsurance that what he votes for he will\nbe willing to maintain against all others.\nThe members of the state board say they\nare not committed to any book or to any\nfirm, and will act with absolute freedom In\nselecting texts In harmony with the\nmost advanced pedagogic thought aa ex\npressed In the state (purse of study.\nA now factor has apjvared In the field\nIn the person of Harr Wagner, of flan\nFrancisco, who will present a new geog\nraphy, based upon the idea of the new\nPacific and Its commercial Interests, with\nspecial relation to the state of Washing\nton. Another surprise to the older pub\nlishing houses Is the appearanoe of Prof.\nHoenshll, of Kansas, who will present his\nfrnrnmar, which hns lately made entrance\nnto the schools of Nebraska Another\nman who expects to go home in good hu\nmor is Ira T. Eaton, of Chicago, who is\nrepresenting his own books.\nThese parties represent bo. ks outside of\nwhat Is known as the \"book trust. \" the\nAmerican Book Company. The latter now\nfurnishes a large percentage of the state\ntext books.\nThis evening the heard of education met\nIn Kupt Hrown's office and arranged a\nprogramme of procedure for Monday after\nnoon.\nThe lobbying done by the book men re\nminds one greatly of a legislative session\nwhile an Important bill is up for consid\neration. These agents are all keen men,\nprobably the best In their line. In some\nInstances agents of th* principal publish\ning houses have been reinforced by mem\nbers of the firms they represent. Not\nonly have the book men been In Olvmpla\nbombarding the state superintendent's of\nfice, hut they have besieged the governor\nami all have visited the members of the\nstate board at their home towns This Is\nhardly to be wondered at, when it Is con\nsidered that in th\" sward to be made\nMonday approximately |l,i\u00bb>.non Is Involved,\nThe labor unions of the state have been\nmilking an earnest tight to havo hooks ae\nleeted that are printed In union establish\nments.

E. Banks,\nthe British Columbia mountaineer arrest\ned here Thursday on a charge of selling\nimaginary gold mines? to Wall street\nfinanciers, has been released from jail.\nHe succeeded in inducing his prosecutors\nto believe that he really owned the claim\nwhich he sold them. They withdrew the\ncomplaint against him and started for\nVancouver, B.

This gave him a certificate\nsigned by the mining recorder of the Atlin\ndistriot. With this and a hundred-pound\nsack of quartz taken from the claim, he\nstarted his operations.

A trip was enceesary\nto Vancouver to square the charge of cat\ntle stealing which he alleged had been\ntrumped up against him In order to detain\nhim as a witness against his father.\nWith this charge hanging over hJm,\nBanks refused to re-enter British Colum\nbia.

Glass wns apparently ap\nproached about the inmo time, but un\nknown to Shaw. Banks told each that\nhe would not part with his own half for\na m'lllon dollars. Glass was the first to\nbecome suspicious, and sent to Atlln for\nan abstract of Banks' olaims, which were\ncalled the T-uckv Jim and NortU St;ir.\nThe recorder's copy showed Shaw's Inter\nest In the claims, so Olass looked him up,\nand the men compared notes. As a re\nsult, Glass visited Atlln, found the claims\nthere and us rich as represented, hut\nBanks' filing was long subsequent to that\nof the real owner, and therefore worth\nless. Glass was so taken with the prop\nerty that he bought a third interest in It\nfor the Montana syndicate, this time front\nthe real owner, however. He returned\ntwo weeks ago and learned of Banks'\nothor escapades through the Post-Intelli\ngencer.\nThere Is reason to believe that Ranks\nworked Toronto capdtallsta on the same\nscheme.

Melville C.\nBrown, of Laramie, Wyo., was in the\ncity today on his way to assume the\nduties of his office, he having recently\nbeen appointed. He goes to the extreme\nnorthern field of labor with a cheerful\nmind, llrmly disposed to accomplish the\ngreatest possible results In tho way \u00ab\u2022:\norganizing Judicial work and relieving\nthe reported congestion of litigation.\nft!la Pinna of Work.\nJudge Brown has never been in Alas\nka, although he is familiar with\nof the Pacific >#rthwest, Including Ore\ngon and Portland in particular. One of\nthe best evidences that he has studied\nAlaskan conditions is observed in the\nplans of work already formulated. These\nnave been laid out so far as it will not\nbe necessary to alter them because of un\nforeseen conditions. First, he will take\nup the litigation of Juneau, Skagway, '\nSitka and other southeastern points. This\nwill be disposed of as fast as possible, of\ncourse observing all due consideration\nfor reasonable time, after which Judge\nBrown hopes to be clear for whatever\nmay arise in and about the Cape Nome\ndistrict.\nWill Go to Cape Nome.\nBecause of the immense rush there\nthis year, an'd the rather involved condi- j\nHon of titles and laws, Judge Brown\napprehends many keen questions. He I\nhopes to be able to open rourt there by\n\u2022 \u00ab\u00bbiii he a date\nwhen business is fairly under way nnd\n.. . _ UMUIOKU tribunal j\nwill be the greatest. All these arrange\nments are contingent on the action of !\ncongress on the pending civil code for I\nthe territory of Alaska. Should that bill ;\npass and three judges be appointed, as ;\nis provided for, of course the one residing\nat St. Michael will have jurisdiction\nover the Nome district. Judge Brown\ncannot forecast far ahead on this ac- !\ncount without inserting a strong sav\ning clause. However, there seems much\nlikelihood that the bill will not reach\nthe tinal stages this session of congress.\nJudge Brown waited some time before |\n'inrtine ait would I\nbe enacted into law, and finally was t\nuiHi ne woti.ti inoi i\u00abiOCced and begin\nwork, as the bill might not get through j\nthe house before adjournment in June.\nThere is another consideration that i\nwould naturally lead Judge Brown to go i\non with his work at once, as it Is com\nmonly understood that he will bo one of\nthe three district Judges appointed should I\nthe bill pass. This fact is conceded gen\nerally, and even If the new law went\ninto effect he would not immediately have\nto disturb his arrangements materially.\niludge Hrovrn'a Long Experience.\nJudge Brown has long experience on\nthe bench, besides a large and lucrative\nlaw practice in Wyoming. He refused\nelection to a state judgeship because he\ndid not care to leave his practice, but\nfinally accepted the position on the fed\neral bench In Alaska. Instead of being\nappalled by the accumulation of litigation\nsince Judge Johnson ceased to hold court\nIn Alaska. Judge Brown is pleased with\nthe prospect of work. He looks with\neagerness to the knotty questions arising\nfrom mining and various other conten\ntions. And this eagerness verities In one\ninstance at least the wisdom of striking\nfrom the Alaskan civil code before con\ngress the provision that a man of 56 years\nor over of age could not be chosen for\na Judgeship there. Judge Brown was\nslightly over this age limit, and while\nthis restriction existed would not accept\na position on the Alaskan bench, as the\npassage of the new law would mean his\nretirement from work barely begun.\nCornea to Seattle Today.\nJudge Brown will go to Seattle tomor\nrow. There he expects to meet Judge\nJohnson, his predecessor, and also learn\nmuch concerning the present statUH of\naffairs. He sails from Seattle on the\nCottage City May 10.\nAe a traveling companion to the new\nJudge. W. J. Hills, also of Wyoming, is\ngoing to the north. Mr. Hills is a lawyer\nof considerable experience nnd many\nfriends, and Is going to Alaska to lonic\nthe country over, with the possible result\nof entering into business somewhere In\nthe north.\nV \\ 141 MA PIIINH GKOWERS.\nMeet and Decide to Join Oared Krult\nAssociation.\nSpecial Dispatch to the Post-Intelligern er.\nNORTH YAKIMA.

There are great\ndepths of emotion in It and It necessitates\ngreater effort and Is more of a strain up\non the nervous system. My preference Is\n'Cleopatra,' the sorceress of the Nile pos\nsessing a weird fasclnatlort for me. Tha\nmajority of Americans seem to lie under\nthe Impression that Sardouu's pi ys have\nno reason for being but to furnish an out\nlet for Sarah Bernhardt's genius and char\nacteristics. This false conception has\ngiven birth In this country to the Idea\nthat Sardou's works are Immoral, un\nwholesome: that his plays consist only of\nfine dramatic situations and marvelous\ntechnique; that they teach no lesion,\npreach no warning, In short, serve no\nother purpose but to demonstrate great\nhistrionic ability.\n\"As an American delineator of Sardou's\nheroines, I have naturally given the mat\nter some thought. lam not In accord with\nthe accepted opinion. In each of Sardou's\nplays I find a sermon preached, a warning\nuttered. Underlying each play I find the\npurpose to formulate a wholesome truth.\nFor example, 'I-a Tosca' symbolizes the\nwill to jealousy and Its dire results; 'Fe\ndroa' the will to vengeance, and the ven\ngeance Is treated In so virile a way that\non the fall of the final curtain can almost\nbe heard 'Vengeance Is mine; I will re-\np.\u00bb>. saith th\u00ab Lord \" \u2022Glsmonda' symbol\nl\u00abe> the will to pride, tea. hes that the\nhighest nobility lurks not In the Mood,\nbut In the heart, that to be born tn the\nupper ranks Is not all sufficient; that\nthere Is a nobility of action, of deed, that\ncounts for something. Historically Cleo\nlatra symbollxes tn passions, the will to\npower or ambition frustrated by her pas\nsion for Antony.\n\"In my opinion the legitimate drama\nshould carry out three objects\u2014 first to In\ndtruet; second, to make one think, fcnd,\nthird, to divert.\"\ni* X X\niT took \"Old Sol\" and his most earnest\nI rays to stop the two months run of\nWard and Vokes and their big travesty\ncompany in Chicago last summer.

The company mirround\nlng Ward and Vokes contains nearly the\nsame list of principals as were seen In\nChicago. The costumes are all new for the\nroad tour and are said to be works of art.\nIt Is distinctly a Ward and Vokes enter\ntainment. Any one who hau ever \u00bb\u00bben \"A\nRun on the Bank\" or \"The Governors\"\nwill know Just what this means. Any one\nwho ha\u00bb never seen either of the two may\nprepare to see in \"The Floor Walkers\"\ntwo and a half hruirs of continual effort by\nforty people to present a series of funny,\ntuneful eplsodee entirely different from\nanything else In the farce comedy field.\nTo this end such creators as Dury Daly,\nMargaret Daly Vokes, the Chicago I.adies'\nQuartette. Hattle Bernard, Will West,\nGeorge Sidney and. John W. Early are to\nbe found supporting Ward and Vokes.\nThere la also a large chorua of pretty\ngirls.\n* Uf &\nTHEATRICAL JtOTES.\nHen.

These conditions im;>>se long\n; and hard labor upon even the sreniuses\n; araon* writers for the stage. More\n! time and thought are often spent on a\nscenario than In writing out the play. It\nmay he ea.id that a drama of the first\nclass is a good year's task.\nThe playwright must keep his char\nacters plainly hef >re him \u00ab11 the while.\nIt is essential that he shall know where\nthey are whether active or idle When\never they stir It should mean fometh.:.*.\nAn Indefinite movem'n tmav spoil the\neffect which he Intends to make The\nI audience sees quite as much as it hears.\nI One of our well-known authors sets\n' small puppets on a miniature sta#e ajid\ni moves them about.

The scene In\nevery detail Is vivid to him without any\nBids. Others make notes on diagrams.\nStill others use whatever small thins*\nhaiipen to 'b\u00ab at hand.

Nonsense? Not If It adlltates\nhis work. His fancy requires Incitement.\nAt the other extreme may b\u00ab men\ntioned tt man who never has to make so\nmuch as a dot on paper to assist his mem\nory as to the action. He has his troubles\nof another kind. He Is compelled to guard\nhimself against confusion and Inconsisten\ncies In the Various Interests of the play\nIn hand. He makes diagrams of them,\nshowing their starts and stops rises and\nfalls, contacts and separations. Thus he\nsees their proportions, and builds them\nup or pulls them down to suit their rela\ntive Importance. This diagram becomes\nan elaborate chart as work progresses. It\nIs clear to him. If to nobody else. It\nguides him In kepelng his principal char\nacters dominant and his miner ones sub\nordinate. lty means of It he moves every\nthing toward that climax which every\nsuccessful drama must reach.\nWhat the actors do, betid* speaking the\nwords of a play, Is called the \"business.\"\nThe old-fashioned way was to Insert that\nword In the ropy at points where special\naction was required. The particulars were\ngiven at the rehearsals. Nowadays the\nauthor is more explicit In his manuscript.\nHe prescribes the movements that each\ncharacter shall make. Nothing* is left to\nchance, nor to the actor's choice. When\nho is to sit and when to stand, where he\nIs to go and how lon* to stay, what feel\ning he Is to show when silent, what de\ngree of emotion he Is to express when\nspeaking\u2014all these directions are set\ndown.\nSome authors tell, also, how the per\nsonage should look. A paragraph de\nscribes each individual much as a novel\nist does It, though very briefly and con\ncisely. This Is frequently extended to the\ncolor of a woman's eyes and hair. Rhe\nmust be tali or short, slim or stout, pretty\ncr ugly, as best serves the purpose. In\nshort, the writer of stage fiction tries hard\nto have his characters look and behave\nexactly as he wishes them to. His design\nmay be carried out. That depends. He\nmay be eminent and obdurate enough to\nhave his own way. In that case his con\ntracts stipulate that not so much as a\nword shall be changed without hla con\nsent.\nThe manner of the acting, also must be\nobedient to his orders. He also may be\nable to dictate the time when the play\nshall be presented, and the theater, too.\nThe selection of actor* may require his\napproval and his authority may extend\nto rehearsals.

It Is exceedingly difficult to\nobtain the actual figures upon which to\nbase this estimate.\nSecond\u2014The county commissioners levy\neach year for school purposes such an\namount a\u00bb the school board Axes; pro\nvided, however, that this amount ao fixed\ncan never In any one year exceed ten\nmills on the assessed valuation of the dis\ntrict.\nThird\u2014The school district may, when au\nthorised by the vote of the people of the\ndistrict, borrow money and Issue bonds of\nthe district therefor In any turn not ex\nceeding 5 per centum of the taxable prop\nerty of the district; and provided, further,\nthat the money so borrowed can only be\nused for paying the outstanding Indebted\nnee* of the district, or for the purchase of\nschoolhouse site or sites, or building one\nor more schoolhouses and providing the\nsame with all the necessary furniture and\napparatus, or for any and all of these\npurposes: and provided further, that If the\namount of bonds to be Issued, together\nwith any unredeemed, outstanding Indebt\nedness, exceeds lty per centum of the tax\nable property of the district, then for such\nbonds threo-flfths of the votes cast at an\nelection Is necessary.\nThe Preaeit I,AW.\nThe present law authorises the school\nboard during each school year, and with\nout H vote of the people, to expend for\npurchase of school sites and orectlon of\nbuildings, the sum of *30,000. 80 this\namount Is figured In as n permanent ex\npense, It not being probable that In the\ncity of Seattle for some time to come this\nnnnunl expense can be dispensed with.\nIn addition to this amount there Is an\nother fixed charge upon the district, being\nthe Interest upon $730,000 bonds heretofore\nIssued, and the annual Interest charged\nagainst which Is JiW.ooo.\nKeeping In mind these fixed charges of\n180,000 for buildings and 140,000 for Interest,\nor $90,000 emh year.

Few parents In Seattle realize\nthe thoroughness with which this work Is\ncarried on here, and the excellent results\nobtained.\nIn the grammar grades the work Is\nelementary, consisting mainly In teaching\nthe children to appreciate color values,\nharmony, light and shade. The course\nIn drawing In the primary and grammar\ngrades ia divided Into three divisions\nstructure, embracing elements of form,\nelements of beauty and structural design;\nenrichment, embracing color, elements\u00abof\nornament and decorative de\u00dflgn; and ap\npearance, embracing perspective drawing,\npictorial drawing and pictures. Some of\nthe specimens of the children's handi\ncraft show great skill In execution.\nWhen the pupil reaches the high school,\nthe courae consists of mechanical draw\ning and practical work In the carpenter\nand blacksmith shops. The course Is\nvery popular. It Is divided Into two peri\nods a week for three of the four years\nspent In the high school.\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\nPROF. B. W. JOHNSON, the present\nInstructor, has been with the school\nsince 1594. and to him Is due much of\nthe credit for the department's success.\nHe Is assisted by his brother. Burtrang\nJohnson. Both wero educated In the best\nEastern schools of manual training. In\nthe shops there are eighty-live pupils and\n325 In the mechanical drawing courses.\nWhen the new high school building is\ncompleted, with Its better facilities for\nwork of all kind, Prof. Johnson expects\nhis department to advance rapidly.\nThe Bft >p work Is curried on In a build\ning at the southwest corner of the school\ngrounds. Part of the building was erect\ned by the pupils themselves. The car\npenter shop Is equipped with a twelve\nhorse power electric motor, eight double\nwoodworking benches, with accommoda\ntions for sixteen, and twelve turning\nlathes. The first year's work Is given to\ncarpentry, wood carving and wood turning\nIn progressive lessons. A drawing of each\nexercise Is first made In the drawing\nroom by the pupil In his shop book, from\nwhich he afterwards works. In the wood\ncarving, small blocks of soft wood are\nused. The \"students are first taught In\nsimple line work, so that they may get\naccustomed to the use of the tools and\ntheir care. \"The sense of form and pro\nportion la developed, the eye and hand\ntrained to accuracy and the will and\nJudgment kept In constant use In courses\nof the first year.\" said Prof. Johnson to\na Post-Intelligencer reporter.\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00a7>\nTHR second year In the shop Is given\nto forging. This work Is entirely dif\nferent from the first year's. The pupil\nmust rely upon himself for his results.\nHl# eye and hand must be constantly un\nder the control of hi* will and Judgment.\nA hastily delivered blow or a wrong\nturn r> suits In serious Injury to the\npiece. On this account the exerc-lse is\nfirst worked out In cold lead, in which\nthe pupil h>n ttrae to reason the how and\nwhere of his efforts Each exercise is\nworked oat by the Instructor before the\nclass. He explains the various steps,\nhow to hold the tron, how to strike, and\nhow to man i\u00ab'> the are. In the drawing\nn i rn the pupil makes & blue print of the\nexercise for us\u00ab In the shop\nSV.<ir the close of the school year.

In the first place it\nIs not a trade school. The scope of any\ntrade is too narrow for educational pur\nposes. Nor does It manufacture articles\nprimarily for use or for sale; the prod\nucts of the shop as a rule have no value\nexcept as exercises illustrating typical\nforms and methods. Manual training is\nas broad and as liberal as Intellectual\ntraining.\n\"The whole aim of the shop is educa\ntional. Were its product manufactured\nfor the market, the student would be\non what he could do best at the expense\nof breadth and versatility. The manual\ntraining school fosters Intellectual life.\nIts sole object Is the finished boy. He\nIs the only article to be put on the mar\nket.\n\"Manual training does not mean simply\nthe use of the hand, nor does It mean\nsimply the training of the hand for the\nsake of the hand, nor for the productive\nskill which that training gives. It is a\ntraining of the hand for the purpose of\nsecuring at the same time, and primarily,\nthe training of the mind, through the\nsenses of touch and perception. When\nthe hand and eye are trained to accurate\nobservation and manipulation, the men\ntal faculties of attention, comparison, re\nflection and judgment are exercised and\ndeveloped.\n\"The constructive faculty, so strong In\nyouth, and which manifests itself even in\nthe youngest of children when the op\nportunity Is given, is allowed its proper\ndevelopment in manual training educa\ntion. The hammer Rnd chisel go hand in\nhand with the pen and book. The instruc\ntion in tool practice Is not allowed to\ndiminish the amount of attention given to\nsketching and drawing designs. Here the\nprinciples of pictorial perspective are\ntaught, sketches from objects and nature\nmade. The sense of form and proportion,\nlight and shade are developed by the use\nof plaster casts. Both rooms arc adorned\nDrawing Room of the SManual Training Department.\nthe other studies. The Intellectual fac\nulties lire developed not less than the\nphysical.\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n. KK ANT'AL training received lt\u00bb first\n/V\\ impetus in this country from the\nRussian educational exhibit \u00bbt the\nCentennial in Philadelphia In 1876. The\ndirector of the Imperial technical school\nat Moscow was the first to evolve a sys\ntematic course of tool Instruction.\n\"Manual training as now upplled to\nschool work in the United States, began\nwith the founding of the St. man\nual training school in 1880. Since that\ntime, particularly within the last four\nteen years. Its growth and spread has\nbeen very rapid, until today It has become\na. facto'r of great importance in public\nschool education In all parts of the coun\ntry It is one outcome of the feeling\nof dissatisfaction with the older methods\nof education, and the effort to make pub\nlic education more practical. Manual\ntraining without teaching any particular\ntrade, teaches the underlying principles\nof them all, bringing the boy or girl In\nclose touch and sympathy with all me-\nI ehanlcal and Industrial arts.\"\n1 KI.OMIIKKIt ST.4M.EY ANSWERS.\nDenies That He ' tinsranteed law\nyer's Fee In Son's nivoree Salt.\nWilliam and Sarah Stanley, the former\n' of whom Is familiarly known as \"Klon\ndiker\" Stanley, yesterday filed their an\nswer to the complaint of Arthur & Wheel\ner In a suit for the collection of attorneys'\nfees for services alleged to haTe been ren\ndered a son of the Stanleys In obtaining a\ndivorce.\nThe defendants allege that they are not\nresponsible for the payment of the fee for\nthe reason that they did not employ the\nattorneys for the purposes alleged.

Haggerty, the so-called mining expert,\nor \"the man with the money,\" is rapidly\ndispelling the golden dreams of the many\nalleged victims, who were assured of sud\nden wealth to be acquired from the com\npany's golden sands of Cape Nome.\nThe proposition of the compttuy In brief\nwas that on the payment of S3O In cash,\nfor the furnishing of miners\" outfits, the\ncompany would provide outfits and trans\nportation for forty miners, who were to\ndevelop the company's claims near Cape\nNome, the miners and company to share\nequally In the profits After coirtracts\nwere signed, a power of atttorney had to\nbe secured, which cost the Investor an\nother J5. Attorney B. J. Austin, of this\ncity, says that during the brief period he\nwss engaged by the company, he drew up\npapers for no less than seventy-five min\ners. How many a former attorney pre\npared papers for is unknown. In fact. It\nIs Impossible, under the manner of the\ncompany's operation, to ascertain how\nmany are the alleged victims of the con\ncern.\nTh\u00ab company about two weeks ago gave\nIt out that the entire members of the pro\nposed expedition ahouM assemble In front\nof the Review building on Wednesday,\nApril 56. the day before the proposed start\nfor Alaska, to have a picture taken of the\ngroup. In view of the fact that Johnson\nand Hagerty left Spokane two days in\nHoughton Edmunds will sing several so\nprano solos.

In 1\u00ab4 Oil ver was the ragular nom\ninee for mayor, and his ejection was sup\n\u2014ed to be a foregone conclusion. A\u25a0* *\n','ke Peter Roche, an itinerant and haJf\n*!tted tinker *\u00bb.\u00ab put up as an oppos:-\n\u2022 ion candidate. When the votes were\nmted at the close of the polls. It was\nfl ind that Roche had a small majority\n' he vo>tes cast. The Jokers, becoming\naiarmed at the result. hunte\u00abl up Roche.\n, for a cash consideration induced him\nto withdraw his candidacy, and Glover\nwas declared the unanimous choice for\nmayor.\nWhat promises to be a vast field f coal\nIs heing npened up on the Pend d'Orellle\nriver, in Stevens county. Within tha pas:\nthree weeka over thlrtv locations have\nbeen made, making in all about 308 claims\nthat have been located by Spokane and\nEastern capitalists.

For this reason it requires capi\ntal to open up coal mines.\nRiverside avenue Is more or less torn\nup this week The City Street Improve- I\nment Company Is relaying the asphalt\nsurface, which had become so full of holes\nas to make the principal thoroughfare\nunsafe for travel It Is scarcely a year\nand a half alnce the pavement was laid.\nSuperintendent Jackson ascribes the poor\npavement to the quality of the asphalt\nfurnished by the Standard Asphalt Com\npany. of San Francisco,.

May s.\u2014Whatever deductions are\ndrawn fnm the stock market must he almost wholly\nnegatived. fur the market continues near the level\nof stagnation. A slight fillip was given to the open\ning by the higher level of prices in London. But the\nroom traders Hosed their contracts before the day's\nend and brought the level of prices back to near\nlast night's close. Sugar moved quite easily, at a\nhigher range than yesterday and exactly recovered\nyesterday's loss as a net result. Long Islsnd was\nquite active and moved up to 89. but closed un\nchanged The bonds of the company continued in\nactive demand. The statement that the Pennsyl\nvania had acquired control found considerable cre\ndence. but the working agreement with the New\nYork Central is believed to be involved in the deal.\nThe story of a steamship service to run from the\nIxwg Island coast was reviv.nl, in connection with\nthe movement in the stock. The reports of the mer\ncantile agencies served to confirm the impression\nof the reactionary course of prices of commodities\nand of trade activity. The current stagnation in\nWall street is the logical outcome of these condi\ntions Buyers are out of the market. But holders\nof securities are* not yet sure that the current re\naction is not making for the ultimate, health of\nbusiness. It is perceived that the recent high level\nof prices was such as not ohly to unduly stimulate\nproduction, but also to de< rca.\u00abc the consumptive\ndemand. Securities are obviously being firmly held\nuntil the problem of the level of prices and the\nvolume of consumption shall adjust itself to afford\na basis for estimating future returns.\nThe stock market has given evidence, during the\nweek, of having reached an adjustment to the new\nconditions presented by the unexpected develop\nments in the iron and steel trade of three weeks\nago. The liquidation induced by that development\noverran itself, as is the invariable rule with specu\nlative movements, and the hears last, week had to\nbid up prices to get hack stocks which had been\nsold short. Tlus week the market has been with\nout the sustaining force of the demand for the over\nsold hears and the vibration of prices has been\ndiminished. The professional traders in stocks, in\nwhose hand* operations have been largely left, have\nmet with little success In moving prices. The de\nclines from their short selling hare brought out\nvery little stock, and the prices attracted uo fol\nlowing to take stocks off their hands.\nBuyers want more light on the future course of\nbusiness before taking on stocks. A large cause of\nperplexity over the outlook is the present reflux of\ncurrency to New Yortt bank reserves, from the\ninterior. The gold export movement, now fairly in\naugurated, is a result of this. Ordinarily the ex\nportation of gold has an unfavorable effect on the\nstock market on account of the apprehension aroused\nthat tightness of money may result. In the present\nmarket that rffect is due to the feeling that the\nplethoric condition of the money market is a regiv\nter of declining interior trade and reduced needs\nfor money, owing to the decreased business. The\nrecent developments in the steel trade give special\npoint to this apprehension. That the country's\nbusiness is not finding full employment for all the\nmonev in the country is evident from the action\ncf the money markets, but the increase in the\nmoney supply seems to be taken insufficiently into\naccount. According to the monthly statement of\nthe United States treasury of the total amount of\nmoney in circulation in the country, inclusive of\ncash in the treasury, the amount, on May 1. 1900,\nshowed an increase for the month of April of $36,-\n270.967. and for the twelve months previous of $126,-\n067.671\nThe bond market hss been dull snd has moved\nin sympathy with storks.\nUnited States old 4s advanced 1 per cent., refund\ning 2s. when issued I, new 4s and 6s 4, and 2a 4 in\nthe bid price.\nBonds.\nT.

SB9.W. The\nbanks now hold $15,978,475 in excees of the require\nment* of the 25 per cent. rule.\nThe Financier says: The New York bank state\nment for the week ending May 5 is stirprising in sev\neral details. To begin with, no local cause can be\nassigned for the expansion of $13,221,400 in loans\nand the corresponding increase of $17,000,000 in de\npewits, although it is said that at least five millions\nof the loan increase was brought about through\ntechnical operations attending the completion of\nthe consolidation of two large banking houses. Tbe\neight millions or over, still unaccounted for. is\nlarger than the events of the week seem to have\ncalled for. but with money easier here than at\nanv point in the world, it is not unlikely that the\nbanks nre taking advantage of an opportunity to\nincrease profits by extending the scope of their\noperations abroad, a course that has been resorted\nto before under similar conditions. This is the\ntheoretical view. As a matter of fact a detailed\nanalysis shows that the loan increase has been\nscattered through a large number of banks. The\ngain of over seventeen millions on deposits is due\nto the loan expansion and receipts of $3,000,000 in\ncash from the interior.\nThe rising deposit total called for $1,27?.300 in\ncreased reserve, so that the effect of the interior\nreceipts was neutralized and $1,095,900 waa taken\nfrom previous accumulations, bringing the present\nexcess to $15,978,475.\nThere is warrant for the assertion that the banks\ndid not gain as much from the interior last week\nas the figures indicate, and that, they actually lost\nto the treasury on geld exports. The specie al\nready forwarded on this movement amounts to\n\u25a0 jwi.ooo. *** while a dec Una in reserve may oper\nate to check the outward How, there scorns to be no\nreason why interest rates should advance. A fac\ntor in the money market, often overlooked in this\nconnection, is the ability of the trust companies to\nloan at minimum rates. The comptroller, in his call\nfor official statements last week, asked for a speci\nfication of trust companies and savings banks de\nposits in national banks. It is known that these\ninstitutions are carrying st least $50,000,000 in na\ntional bank*. The state banks also report hoary\ntrust company deposits. The loans snd deposits\nof the banks at the present time are over $100,000,000\nin excess of the averages at the opening of the\nyear, while reserves are only four millions higher.\nContinued receipts from the interior are looked for\nfor some time.\n% % %\nFOREIGN.\nFinancial.\nNEW YORK.

Following thsm as Hop o* My Thumb\nfollowed the phlte pebbles, he found them\nleading to the roadway, across it, into a\nfield, and there the clew gave out. Evi\ndently someone had carried a bag of cough\ndrops over that route, a t\u00bbag with a hole in\nit. through which the cough drops fe!i\nand scattered.\nThe Indication was precious, hfctuw\nthere was precisely a ha* of sugar-coated\nrough drops atnooff the merchandise that\ndisappeared the night before from the fast\nthrough freight train. Reporting the Inci\ndent, a careful search was made of every\nthing in the vicinity and. much to the\nHstoniahment of the detectives, the tracks\nwere found to he thickly smeared with\nlard. Smeared with lard! f-ard! Why. of\ncourse. It flashed on them Immediately\nthat someone must have put that lard\nthere. Why? That was the mystery, and\nthey pondered over it three days Then\none of the detectives had a great thought.\n\"Ijet us lie In watch around that neigh\nborhood and perhaps something will turn\nup.\"\nThat night as the detectives of the Paris,\nLyons A Midi Hallway Company were ly\ning hidden by the track thay perceived\ndark shadows moving toward them. Three\nmen. a hoy and two women came up and\nbegan mysterious operations. They car\nried buckets snd worked kneeling down\nalong the track. They were gTeaslng the\nrails again. The detectives allowed them\nto work on In peace till all was finish\ned. They remained in hiding while the\nmysterious track greasers, all tut one man.\nhurried down the line In the direction of\nParis. They waited. The moments teemed\nlong. At last, however, the rum?>ll>wr of an\napproaching train was heard.

In the recent debate\non the naval appropriation bill, Congress\nman Loudensleger. of New Jersey, point\ned out that never has thcr*- been so great\ncompetition among the nations for for\neign commerce a\u00ab now, and foreign com\nmere* rannot be maintained to any con\nsiderable extent unless a nation is pre\npared to protect its interests against en\ncroachment. In clinching his argument,\nCongressman Loudenslagrr submitted fig\nures and tables, which are reproduced on\nthis page.\nOn the topic \"Our Fighters of the Sea,\"\nRldney Graves Koon, In Iy-slles Wee&ly,\ndemonstrates that the fighting\nvalue of the American ships, due largely\nto the adoption of the new high-powered\nguns, is very evident. Not one of the\nforeign ships approaches the new Maine\nin this respect, and the N>w Jersey Is\nstill further removed from European\nstandards. It may be of interest to note\nthat the Oregon's fighting power, comput\ned on her condition when she fought at\nHantlago, may be represented by 21H.&56\nfoot-tons per minute, which has been In\ncreased by the adoption of smokeless\npowder and the installation of six-inch\nrapid-fire guns in place or her six-inch\nslow-Are guns, to 319.2JW. This Is far be\nlow the figure for any other ship men\ntioned by Mr. Koon, but it is only fair\nto remark that the bulk of the Orion's\nbattery consists of heavy, slow-firing\nguns, capable of great penetration and\nexecution, but not showing up To great\nadvantage when it comes to a compari\nson like the above. In all the ships the\nheaviest part of the energy may be trac\ned to the six-inch rapid-fire guns, which\ngtve, in the from three to five\ntimes as heavy a discharge per minute as\ntfo the monster pieces heading the lists.\nOur now armored cruisers* will prove to\nbe the peem of any afloa't. and could at\ntack, with a high chance of sufrees, any\nbut the mos-t powdWul battleship If, a\u00bb\nIs reportfwi. the armor-belt is to be ten\nlncht*4 thl'k.

This tv-ittrry would be prevtouMy\ncharged bv the boat's own engines. Onj\ncharge of the battery ought to enable her\nto run seventy-five miles under water.\nWhen submerged her spe. 1 would not\nexceed four or five knots When cruising\nshe can travel a little faster. She has\nmade a speed of seven or eight knots on\nthe surface,\nAs originally designed, the Holland had\nthree weapons. One was an expulsion\ntube of the same type that the ordinary\ntorpedo boat carries. This delivers th#\ntorpedo without any special violence. Tha\nWhitehead projectile Is an automobile; or\nself-propelling affair, it carries a tiny\nscrew and automatic sleeting apparatus,\nand takes care of itself when one*\nlaunched. The Holland is planned to car\nry three Whiteheads 12 feet long nnd II\nInches in diameter. One would be placad\nIn the expulsion tube ready for xervlo\u00bb,\nand the others would be arranged along\nside the tube within the boat. The tuba\nopens out In front.\nBeside* the ordinary rudder, a vertical\nplane to direct the boat's course to tha\nright or left, the Holland lias a second on*,\nextending In a horlxontal plane, nnd in\ntended to alter the level.\nThe chief virtue of a submarine torpefo\nboat Is that she can render herself mors\ncompletely Invisible than a vessel that\nalways stays on the surface. She could\ncertainly deliver an attack by night with\nout detection, and It 1* even possible that\nshe could do so by day. The latter li\naltogether out of the question with isy\nother type of torpedo boat. Of Count,\nsuch tiny craft cannot navigate In rough\nwater. They are fitted to live and \u00abork\nonly In or near harbors. They are meant\nfor coast defense only. They require spe\ncial skill and courage on the part of ot\u00df-\nfern and crew Hut (hey can do wh\u00bb! WO\nother torpedo boat can, ami have it <SH\u00bb\ntlnct field of uaefulneaa before them.",

They were rul\ned by a chief who had one son\u2014\na child of ten summers, who would inherit\nhis father's throne when h\u00bb died. Now.\nthe chief had ten nephews who wished to\ntake his place, but the chief knew that\ntheir tum-tums (hearts) were bad and he\ngrieved to think of the sorrow that would\ncome to his child. When he heard the\nSoakhale Tyee (Oreat 3pirit) call him to\nthe happy hunttrg gro'.m<V> *\u25a0\u25a0 toWl his\nmother, who was by his side, all that wn*\nIn his heart. He said, \"Keep my son near\nyour side until he Is grown, for \u201ehe oad\nsiwarf) will kill him.\"\nThe chief had seen but forty summers\nwhen he wrs laid with his fathers. \u00bb\u00bbe\nwas wrapped In the finest of furs and all\nhis arms and clothing were put in the\nhollow trunk of a cedar tree wltn hi?\ncorpse. The tribe incurred for many suns,\nsitting In the ashes of his camp lire and\ncrawling on their nands and knees in :.ie\ndust for a long d!\u00abtance to show their -sor\nrow.\nThe grandmother kept the tenas man\n(little bay) wits ter all the time. One\nday ehe took him with her to gather oi*l-\nUes (berries) and ne strayed a short dis\ntance frran her. On? of the bad Indians\ntook him and carried him up to the slough\nand hid him from his people.\nWhen the lumel (old woman) found that\nhe was gone, she was frantic with grief,\nshe looked everywhere but found him :,<>t.\nPhe went back to her house and told her\nfriends of the great loss. One of the ten\nnephews told he;' that the Stick ElAjsh\nis.nrlt of the woods) had taken him av -y.\nWhen the Stick -iwash heard tha' they\nt lid so great a kllm-in-a-whlt ('.let on him\n:.t- was Very sol-e\\ (angry) and next day\nwhen the ten were quarreling atfout who\nshould be chief, he mctn-ook-ed black tam\nenus (magic) and turned the tribe into\nheaps of clam shells and fish bone*.\niff MUSI GROW A MUSTACHE\nHarvard Seniors Will Apply Telepathic\nProcesses to First Marshal to Ful\nfill a Poetic Prophecy.\nmfwn* astonishing psychological exper\nfnv-nt is about \\ \u2022-.\u2022 1\nyfl it Harvard Its success will fully\nW n it.- the triumph of mtikl\nm/ O\nthe Boston Globe, is nothing less than an\nattempt on the part of several members\nof the senior class, by successive and com-\nbined efforts of their will power, exercised\nin common upon a single object, to grow\n\u2022i mustache upon the fare of their first\nmarshal. The details of the experiment\nhave not yet been revealed, but it is un\nderstood that they will be conducted in\naccordance with the latent psychological\nprocesses of telepathy. The outlines of\nthis beneticent conspiracy have just trans\npi red.\nPor some time, it appears several mem\nbers of the class of 190i>. at Harvard, have\nexpressed their desire that the first mar\nshal of their class should grow a mus\ntache. W A. M. Burden, of New Tork.\nwho was elected to that post of honor\nlast December, has never worn such a dis\ntlnguisning mark, but If the entreaties of\nhis friends prevail, he will lead the pro\ncession nn \u00ab .ass day, singled out from his\nbrother officers by a light tuft of hair on\nhis upper lip. The reason, strangely\nenough. Is a literary one. which bears no\nrelation to a desire to make tha first mar\nshal seem older than he is.\nTwenty-two years ago last January, the\nfirst marshal of the class of I*oo was de\npicted by Oliver Wetidell Holmes, in a\npoem read before the surviving members\nof his class.

Just on\nthe eve of his departure for Europe, where\nhe had planned to rest for several years\nbefore hi? final retirement from business.\nThe trip was abandoned, the inspiration\nWas realized, and one of the greatest in\ndustrial combinations of the age was\nbrought into being.\nLike that of many other successful\nmen, the career of John W. Gates\non a Western farm. His father was a\nsmall farmer in Dupnse county, Illinois,\nwhere Mr. Gates was l>orn \"n M ly 8. 1\u00ab.\nThe elder Gates came of good old Puritan\nstock, the family having moved from Mas\nsachusetts to Illinois when Chicago was a\nfrontier fort.\nJohn W. Gates was graduated at Wheat\non college, and subsequently was gradu\nated from the Northwestern college at Na\npelville, 111., being a member of the class\nof 73. Immediately upon leaving college\nhe became a grain merchant at Turner,\n111. Hift success began on the verv\nthreshold of his business career. He sold\nout his business at a handsome r'rofit In\n1875. and then opened a hardware store in\nWarrenhurg. Mo. He made a success of\nthis also, but the town was too small for\nhim, and he moved to St. Louis, whore the\nwire business, then in its infanty, attract\ned his attention.\nHe formed a firm of the name of J. W.\nGates & Co.. which in 1&S1 became the\nSouthern Wire Company. This, too, pros\npered, and formed the nucleus of the first\ncombination which Mr. Gates brought\nabout. He saw that several of the local\nwire companies were curtailing their\nprofits and restricting their enterprise by\nrate-cutting and competition on unwise\nlines. He con/elvel the idea of bringing\nthem into harmonious relations and re\nducing expenses toy operating the whole\nbusiness under one name and manage\nment. This brought about the formation\nof the Braddock Wire Company at Pitts\nburg. which was the forerunner of the\npresent wire trust. It was formed in JSM.\nThe combination Idea hfr this time had\ntaken complete possession of Mr. Gates,\nwho was as daring as he was ambitious.\nHo began to buy stock of a number of\nbis rival companies, among them the lowa\nBarb Wire Company, of Allentown. Pa.;\nthe St. l/oula Wire Mill, and the Baker\nWire Company, of Ix>c4\u00bbport. 111.\nIn 1890 Mr. Gates had his first great in\nspiration. Falling In an effort to bring\nall the great barb wire companies into\none combination, he succeeded in induc\ning about 95 per cent, of the steel wire\nmill* in the country to form a joint cell\ning agency under the name of the Colum\nbia Patent Company, which was to mar\nket the produit of the various mills.\nThis project lasted about six months,\nwhen it was succeeded by the Consolidated\nSteel and Wire Company, which was a\ncombination of nearly ail the principal\nsteel wire < ompanies of this country.\nnight. But wo are holding a regular\nnightly meeting from that hour until mid\nnight here in Exeter hall, and it is becom\nlnb more and more largely attended. We\nlearned the lesson of this specialised work\nfrom the success of your American ofwo\n<iatlons among scholars and railroad men,\nof which Mr. Vanderbllt was the president,\nand we are enlarging our sphere of action.\nWe have special work now among law\nyers an l bankers as well.

He Immedi\nately set about to exit out a career for\nhlmsrdf in this wider field. After peveral\nyears of labor he formed the great Fed\neral Steel Trust, which Is composed of\nthe Illinois Steel Company, the Minnesota\nIron Company, the Federal Steel Com\npany, the Lorain Steel Work') and a num\nber of smaller concerns. When this or\nganization was successfully launched, two\nyears ago. just at the beginning o? the\ngreat industrial revival which followed\nthe Spanish-American war. It became an\nattractive medium of speculation and in\nvestment to the public, and Mr. Gates,\nwho had token his ivav for the work he\nhad done In the common stock of the new\ncompany. sold out at a profit which is\nestimated to have been about $\",,000,000.\nHe. told his friends at the time that th s\nwas all the money he h\u00abd coveted, and\nall that he could ever spend if he lived\n100 years\n\"l have got enough money,\" he said.\n\"I've been a busy man all my life, and I\nam going to quit and gv> to Europe. In\n< idem ally I may break the bank of Monte\nCarlo \u2014who knows?\"\nBut more inspiring- games awaited him\nin the broader field of Wall street. A new\ninspiration came to him the American\nSteel and Wire Company, he thought,\nneeded reorganization. The capital stock\nwas too small. The puiblic had eageri-v\nbought the Federal Steel Company stock,\nand he thought that it would take as\nreadily to an additional capitalization of\nAmerican Steel and Wire. He therefore\nobtained a charter from New Jersey,\nbought the old American Steel and Wire\nCompany, whose capital was $24,000,000,\ngathered in all the steel and wire com\npanies of the country, whose combined\ncapital was $33,1100,000. ond formed a new\ncompany with a capitalization of $00,000,-\nCOO. The company was successfully float\ned, and it is believed Mr. Gates\nmade another $5,000,000 our of his insplra\ntlon.\nTwo of Mr. Gates' characteristics which\nhave attracted most attention, and have\nperhaps been among the greatest factors\nin his success, are his unflinching nerve\nand his willingness to take long chances.\nHe has been ae<\u00abseji of being an inveter\nate gambler, and! although the term\nsounds har*h, Mr. Gates himself admits\nthat he Is nothing loath to a few\nthousand on the turn of a card, the roll\nof a die, or the tape that the ticker reels\noff.\nThe famous game of cards which he\nplayed at the Waldorf-Astoria several\nweeks ago. in which he Is said to have\nlost several thousand dollars, was not his\nonly venture on the green cloth.
